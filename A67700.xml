            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Publiſher TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AFter ſo many pamphlets of falſe and impious Politicks, which have poiſoned the minds of people with evil notions of government, tending to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all eſtabliſht rules and orders of juſtice, equity, and
<pb facs="tcp:43868:3"/> common honeſty, in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and practice of which the happineſs of a nation doth conſiſt, the heat and violence of paſſion being now ſomewhat aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and perſons more at leiſure to attend to the ſober counſels and dictates of reaſon, it will not, I hope, be judged an ill grounded preſumption, to ſuppoſe, that this diſcourſe written with great ſtrength of reaſon and argument, after long and ſerious deliberation, and a deep reſearch into the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and eſſential laws of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and the conſtitution of the Engliſh government, and done ſeveral years ſince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice, or partiality, or deſign to gratify a private paſſion or intereſt, will meet with a reception and entertainment, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the great name of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and the excellency of the
<pb facs="tcp:43868:3"/> performance among all ſuch, as have learning and skill to judge, and candor and honeſty to ſubmit to the power and convictions of truth. For as to the diſciples and followers of Buchanan, Hobbs, and Milton, who have exceeded their Maſters in downright impudence, ſcurrility, and lying, and the new modellers of Commonwealths, who under a zealous pretenſe of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rights of a fanſied ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal contract againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Monarchs, are ſowing the ſeeds of eternal diſagreements, confuſions, and bloody wars through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world (for the influence of evil principles hath no bounds, but like infectious air ſpreads every where) the peaceable, ſober, truly Chriſtian, and Church-of-England-Doctrine, contained in this book, being ſo directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their furious, mad, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,
<pb facs="tcp:43868:4"/> and fanatical maxims, it cannot otherwiſe be expected, but that they will ſoon be alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and betake themſelves to their uſual arts of ſlander and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and grow very fierce and clamorous upon it. Whatever ſhall happen, it is not out of a deſign to careſs and flatter one Party, or to provoke and exaſperate ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this book is at this time publiſhed, but to do ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto truth, and to reſtore it to its native beauty, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off thoſe masks and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, with which it has of late been disfigured, and to ſettle mens minds with true notions of the original of government. For diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of this nature, founded upon law and reaſon, will hold at all times, and will never be unſeaſonable.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:43868:4"/>
            <p>I ſhall not run out into any unneceſſary or exceſſive commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and praiſe of the Author, nor do I now pretend to write his juſt and full character; it may ſuffice to ſay in ſhort, that he was a Gentleman of ſincere piety, of ſtrict morals, of a great and vaſt underſtanding, and of a very ſolid judgment; a true Son of the Church of England, and conſequently a zealous aſſerter and defender of the truly Chriſtian and Apoſtolical doctrine of non-reſiſtence; always loyal and faithful to the King, his Maſter, in the worſt of times, whoſe fortunes he ſteadily followed, and upon whom he had the honour to attend in ſeveral places, during the courſe of the wars, particularly at Edge-hill, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and at the treaty in the iſle of Wight; and who by his wiſe conduct, and faithful advice and
<pb facs="tcp:43868:5"/> behaviour, gained a good eſteem in his royal judgment: and yet at the ſame time he was a true hearted Engliſh-man; a great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his Country; and one, who wiſhed as well to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the eſtabliſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and laws, as any of thoſe demure Pretenders, who ſat in the ſame Parliament of forty one with him, and raiſed that rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their rightful Soveraign, as he openly called it in the Houſe of Commons after the reſtoration, when ſome were making excuſes for it, from which we are to date all the miſeries and confuſions, which we have undergone, and do ſtill labour under. A reflexion upon thoſe ſad times, and the villainous principles, upon which they then acted, put him upon writing this compendious diſcourſe, in which he has markt out a plain and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:43868:5"/> way to preſerve, and, when loſt by fatal miſcarriages, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our peace and happineſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the honour, the ſtrength, the riches, the trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The notions here laid down, are true and juſt, and tend to the quiet and advantage of mankind in general, and have their weight and uſe in all Countries, where the laws of natural and civil juſtice prevail. It is an exact Scheme or Idea of government, derived from its firſt principles, in which he ſets forth the neceſſary and eſſential powers of Soveraignty, the virtues of a Prince, the indiſpenſable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Subjects, the qualifications of a Counſellor of State, and the method of a wiſe adminiſtration and conduct in all emergencies, whether in relation to domeſtick or foreign affairs, or to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conditions and profeſſions of
<pb facs="tcp:43868:6"/> men in a well conſtituted king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This great Man, after his retiring into the Country, where he ſeemed to live above the world, and to be no way affected with the glittering pomp and glory of it, which he with a true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind deſpiſed, addicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to reading, ſtudy, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: and that ſo many ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wiſe thoughts, as his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were, might not be wholly loſt, he put them down in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for his own private ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, in a due method and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, one depending upon another, to give them greater ſtrength and beauty: and being very aſſiduous in his contemplations (if not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the neceſſary buſineſs of life, by viſits of friends, by journies to town, for two or three months in the year, to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a place, which was his firſt
<pb facs="tcp:43868:6"/> preferment in the Court, and by the exerciſes of an undiſſembled piety and devotion) he had an opportunity of writing ſeveral quires of paper upon various ſubjects, (for his admirable and inquiſitive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius was not confined to any one particular ſtudy and learning) as Divinity, Philoſophy, Hiſtory, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of England, Practical Devotion, and the like. This I now publiſh, was written in the year <hi>1678,</hi> (and deſigned as an appendix to his Memoires of the reign of King Charles the firſt, of moſt bleſſed memory, which hereafter may ſee the light, when more auſpicious times ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and favour the publication) which he, being very exact and curious in his compoſitions, did often refine upon. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this care, there ſeems to be a defect, page <hi>13,</hi> which he
<pb facs="tcp:43868:7"/> deſigned to fill up, and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs did it, as I find by a reference made there to ſome looſe paper, which I could never meet with. But however as it is, I doubt not, but that this diſcourſe will be highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and uſeful to the young Sons of the Nobility and Gentry, the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes of their Country, and who one day by their virtue, courage, loyalty, wiſdom, and learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting their birth and quality, will make a great figure in it: for the ſeaſoning of whoſe minds, capable of the higheſt and nobleſt impreſſions, with virtuous and true notions of Policy, and for their direction and ſervice, it is chiefly publiſhed, and to whom therefore it is humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</p>

            <p>GOD and nature made men ſociable creatures,<note place="margin">Government as examined by reaſon.</note> which appears by this, that every man affects a companion; which ariſes from this, that every ſingle man ſtands in need of anothers help. Men could not have liv'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a body politick, if God had not diſpoſed the natural inclinations of their minds for ſuch a ſociety; and the ſame reaſon, that leads them to co-habit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, exacted from them the preferring publick good before private intereſt, or the whole before any part; ſo as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is an ordinance of God, and not an invention of man, and ariſes not,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43868:9"/> as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would make it, from the paſſion of fear, which one man had of another, but from the moral virtue of juſtice, to do as one would be done unto.</p>
            <p>This makes the politick body ſo much to reſemble the natural. The brain muſt be diſtinguiſht from the heart, and the heart from the liver. If one part give life, another muſt ſenſe, and a third nutrition. The underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Prince, (or ſoveraign power) muſt give the law, and the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (or Nobility) muſt influence the nerves or inſtruments of motion thro' the whole body or ſubordinate Officers, to ſet on work the muſcles or organical members, or Commonalty, to perform the ſeveral offices, which belong to the ſeveral faculties of the ſoul of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But we will not follow affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly metaphors or reſemblances, which only ſerve for illuſtration, but not for proof.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Government and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</note>Government and Governors are both Gods ordinances: for though He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the ſole Legiſlator in all thoſe matters, which concerned mans ultimate happineſs; yet he left men by the light of their own natural reaſon, to make ſuch laws, as concern'd their civil inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, or their concerns of this life, as natural reaſon dictated unto them. And becauſe no ſociety could be formed and kept together, but by equal and juſt laws, nor thoſe laws executed but by ſome Perſons, therefore both laws and Governors were made ſacred; the one to be obſerved, and the other to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced; and therefore God owns both, and puts an impreſſion of part of his own honor, both on humane laws and Soveraign Perſons, though both theſe may be infirm and failing; for Princes or Soveraigns may err, as well in making laws, (or in their judgments about them) as in the execution of them, or in their own manners. And therefore God oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Princes to be well adviſed about making laws, and as nigh as they could, to follow ſound reaſon, and the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, and to do all with deliberation and good advice, and with an eye to publick utility.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, becauſe theſe concerns were but about matters of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43868:10"/> nature, and that coming under ſo many divers circumſtances, it often puzled a ſincere and a wiſe Governor what to ordain, and the narrowneſs of mens underſtandings often making that (whilſt the buſineſs was in councel or agitation) appear beſt, which as ſoon as perfected, was often diſcerned not to be ſo, and ſo wiſdom and ſincerity (though not likely ſo groſly, or ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) might fail in councel, as well as folly and negligence: therefore he ſtampt his own authority both upon human laws and Governors,<note place="margin">The reverence due unto au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> thereby to keep them both from being diſputed. And upon this ground it was, that laws were by the ſame authority that made them, to be revoked or repealed. Thus the human authority, from whence theſe laws flowed, ſilenced all private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and became indiſputable, there being nothing to be put in the ballance with it: it being only the prerogative of God's Laws to be entertained for their own excellency, mens for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or ſtation they were in. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all Government had been precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or ſubjected ſo to change, as to be unſteady or endleſs, and ſo uſeleſs. This every maſter of a family ſhall find, if he give way to his wife, children, and ſervants to diſpute his commands, much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43868:11"/> more then a Lord or Soveraign over a whole nation. And this ſhould make every maſter of a family as careful to keep up the honor of his Prince in his great family, as he would his own in his little family.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Soveraignty muſt be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary.</note>Soveraignty therefore was by divine ordinance made both arbitrary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable; elſe it could never have anſwered the true ends of government. Divine wiſdom therefore neceſſarily armed (even in behalf of the governed) the ſupream Governors with theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers following.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The powers of ſoveraignty, or the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of it.</note>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A power, though not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a religion, (for God had done that) yet to protect it, and to look unto the good adminiſtration of it: ſo as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral piety were cheriſht, and God's word or revelations (ſuch as every nation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed ſo at leaſt) were reverenced, and by publick authority maintained: and thus far every ſtate or government, as well Gentile as Jew, have intereſted themſelves in matters of religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A power to make laws, or ſuch as related to the civil concerns, or good and ſafety of that people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A power to maintain all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign prerogatives, which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily lodged in the Soveraign, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43868:11"/> maintenance of his own authority: for in vain had been the firſt two, if there had been no proviſion made for the laſt. For if Innovators and Conſpirators might act ſecurely, and Government be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined, and Governors expoſed, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate mens peace would ſoon be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and new laws, and new gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors frequently obtruded upon them: therefore every one was bound with life and fortune, to defend the prerogatives of the Government he lived under, as much as the municipal laws, by which he was maintained in his life, liberty, and property.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A power to pardon the breach of laws; ſince mercy adorns the throne as well as juſtice, and no hand is to hold forth this ſcepter, but his, who holds the ſword, that ſo the Soveraign might be as well loved as feared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A power to execute the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of the laws: that thus autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might be feared for its power, as it was to be beloved for its clemency.</p>
            <p>And the forfeiture or advantage, that accrued by the penalty, (if pecuniary) was anſwerable to the Exchequer, ſince the offence was againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:43868:12"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A power to diſpenſe with laws: for circumſtances often make this power equitable, in relation to times as well as perſons, who may ſtand in need of, or merit ſuch diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> A power of equity was neceſſarily entruſted with Soveraigns, becauſe there would be often occaſion to abate the ſeverity of laws; for if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities in contracts and penalties in laws ſhould be always taken, laws would often be ſnares, and often too burthenſome to be born.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> A power to ſtamp monies, or to appoint ſome one thing, which ſhould be the ſtandard unto all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, or which ſhould equal the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of them.</p>
            <p>Which is a great evidence of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; ſince here is a power, that in a Prince's own dominions (and upon ſuch conjunctures of times, as may be, when ſuch a power, even for want of treaſure, and for common ſafety, may require it) he can appoint this ſtandard to be of an inferior value to the thing it is changed for; the authority of the Prince mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that valuable among buyers and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers at home, (though not abroad) which anſwers not to the intrinſick value of the thing bought.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43868:12"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> A power to raiſe tribute, cuſtoms, and taxes for the ſupport of the government, <hi>viz.</hi> the expences and ſplendor of a Court, the guards of a Prince, the fortifications by land, and navies by ſea, and expences of Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all theſe muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a publick treaſure, which muſt ariſe from ſingle mens private wealth, which proves property; for if ſingle men had no property, there could be no ſuch diſtinction, as private wealth and publick treaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> A power to call together Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and Synods, and to diſſolve them; ſo as no men in numbers (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe danger may ariſe to the peace thereby) have in any well ordered State liberty to meet together, but as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted thereunto by authority, leaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes ſhould tumultuate or innovate, and bring petitions on their ſpears head, or make private judgment ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with publick authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> A power to create a Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Prince being the fountain of all honor; as likewiſe to make all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State at home, as great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Judges, Councellors, and all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Magiſtrates; for ſupream pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt be the root of all other powers and of all titles. And it muſt be but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43868:13"/> one in it ſelf; for power, that is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace, is capable of no rivalſhip or co-ordination; for that would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract obedience at home and abroad; for no foreign nation can entertain trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with any other nation, whole ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty or ſingleneſs of power appears with uncertainty, where it is lodged. So as co-ordination is inconſiſtent with all kinds of Government; for two of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual powers, ſince they may be of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers minds, muſt diſtract, cannot ſettle, or make peaceable any government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> A power of ſending Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors unto foreign Princes; the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors office being to repreſent the Prince, as the Prince doth his whole nation. And by this means commerce about trade, leagues offenſive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive are made with other nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A power of making war and peace; for it is fit, that none judge of the proper reaſons and ſeaſons for theſe great engagements, but that Perſon, (or thoſe perſons) in whom the ſupremacy and ſoveraignty is lodged. Princes are prudent, when they obſerve the bent and inclination of their people, in affairs even of this great conſequence: but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects invade the Princes right, when they intermingle herein more than humbly ſhewing their ſentiment of it.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:43868:13"/>
            <p>Theſe are the neceſſary qualifications of all kind of Soveraignty, and theſe are called prerogatives, or regal powers; for no Kingdom, Common-weal, or State can want theſe; and theſe powers muſt be lodged in one, or ſelect perſons, and ſo the Government and the Governors ſtand both by the order of God, or by his divine inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Now to acknowledge ſupream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and yet to undermine them in theſe rights, is a ſubtil part of diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for give them a great title, and no power to determine the moſt important concerns of it, or not to diſpenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, and they will ſoon be reputed but as idols, be firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and then dethroned. How they may herein be limited, unto the end, that he or they may the more deliberately exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute theſe powers, ſhall be ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Theſe powers the Prince or State (nay the people) if they underſtood their own concern, are as much bound to defend, as they are the municipal laws of the land, made in behalf of themſelves: for prerogatives are to be kept as ſacred as laws. One is to defend the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other the ſubjects under the government. One ought to be as truly made uſe of for the ſafety and utility of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43868:14"/> the whole body of the people, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for particular men; for true pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſafety was the mother of all royal prerogative, and <hi>Salus populi ſuprema lex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee theſe powers, to the end they may be executed,<note place="margin">Sovereign perſons.</note> muſt be lodged in perſons; and no Government can want theſe powers or perſons: ſo as whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver invades either of them, overthrows all government, or diſables it to provide for the ſafety of the people, or body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick.</p>
            <p>If the powers be lodged in one perſon, then the form of Government is called Monarchy.</p>
            <p>If in a few chief or choice men Ariſtocracy.</p>
            <p>If in all the people, it is a Democracy.</p>
            <p>Deviations from theſe are termed
<list>
                  <item>Tyranny.</item>
                  <item>Oligarchy.</item>
                  <item>Ochlocracy.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For my own part, I cannot believe that there can be any ſuch kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as pure Democracy; for if the ſupream power be lodged in the whole people, then they are both governors and governed, and many abſurdities will follow, as will be ſhewed hereafter.</p>

            <p>† † † † † †</p>
            <p>Hence it is,<note place="margin">Paternal power.</note> that God made paternal power the foundation of all civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And hence it is, that moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning men agree, that Monarchical government is beſt ſuiting with God's ordinance, and the benefit of ſociety; for even <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> bred in and amongſt Republicks, allows Monarchy,<note place="margin">Monarchy the beſt form of government.</note> as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt organ for the ſoul of government to work by, as through its unity leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to diviſions, and as fitteſt for ſecreſie and expedition: and being hereditary, not elective, it is agreed freeſt from facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or laying wait for changes, or bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing for voices, which are unavoidable and dangerous in all popular elections; ſo as it may be ſaid, by all theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral advantages, God inſtituted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and permits only the other forms.</p>
            <p>When paternal government ceas't,<note place="margin">How pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ceaſt, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have a hand in the election.</note> that is to ſay, when the <hi>Communis ſtirps,</hi> or firſt parent, was grown through col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral lines not to be readily known, or to be come at; and that genealogies and relations were not exactly kept, and that mixt Families were numerouſly joyned together, and when large Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were ſent ro plant void countries,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43868:15"/> then choice was made of ſome eminent man to be a Leader, or Duke, or Guide, or Prince, or whatever they would call him; (or of ſome <hi>Optimates,</hi> or chief men, or <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or what form beſt pleaſed) to go in and out before this people, or to exerciſe ſoveraign power. Thus the people, who had no hand in the government (for that was purely God's ordinance) came at laſt, when paternal government ceaſt, to have a power of conſent in the diſpoſing and lodging the Government by one or more perſons. Hence it is, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is called by one Apoſtle, <hi>the ordinance of God,</hi> and by another, <hi>the ordinance of man;</hi> for power is original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God in the abſtract and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it; though in the concrete or ſpecification, or in reſpect of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereunto belonging, (as whether the title be King or common-weal, the juriſdiction limited or abſolute) from men; which in effect is the true expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reconciliation of the two great Apoſtles. But be the form what it will, the laſt appeal muſt be ſoveraign, and muſt have power to exerciſe all the beforementioned marks of ſoveraignty: or elſe the government muſt be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for government muſt be abſolute, and the quality of abſolute rule is ſuch,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43868:15"/> ſays <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that it can ſtand but in one alone.</p>
            <p>However, though he, that aſſumed this power without conſent, was an Uſurper, yet when the power was once lodged or diſpoſed by conſent or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, it could not be reaſſumed; for tho' the people ſubmitted their own necks, yet they gave not the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the government by an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible providence, when the form is agreed on, is to be aſſigned to God. And it appears to belong to him,<note place="margin">Why Princes were not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable.</note> ſince the eſſential part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the power of life and death belongs ſingly to him; for no man hath power over his own life, and therefore he cannot give it to another. His wiſdom therefore thought not fit to truſt the giddineſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, with a matter of ſuch concern, even unto their own peace and welfare; for often changes, which they would have affected, would have been more pernicious to the good of ſociety than moderate, nay, immoderate preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Hence it was even in order to publick-weal, that ſoveraign authority, and his, or their Perſons, that execute it, was ſet above all private judgment to avoid diſputes.</p>
            <p>The ſoveraign power, by conſent once lodged in one or many, for the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43868:16"/> ſame reaſon is not reaſſumable; for we ſee originally, that power was never, or could ever be, lodged in the diffuſive body of the people, who had not a power over their own lives, and ſo could leſs have it over others; for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was no humane invention, but Gods ordinance. When people firſt elected their Governor, we may ſay it anſwered unto Gods providence; when by rebellion or defection they changed him, it was his permiſſion; for when a people demerit of him, he withſtands not their intangling themſelves, and ſcratching themſelves with their own briars. So as when the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is once ſetled, the poſterity or ſucceſſors of that People are bound by the conſent and choice of their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe they are reputed to live in their Predeceſſors, and their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are ſaid to be alive in them. And thus, when providence, in the place of natural governors or parents, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced civil,<note place="margin">A people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are in the ſtate of

                  </list>
               </note> the whole diffuſive body of the governed were to be (in this reſpect of change of their form of government) reputed in the ſtate of wives or of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or minors; for though the one might have choſen, whether ſhe would have diſpoſed her ſelf to ſuch a man to be her husband, yet having

Yet both husband and guardian, ought to do all right to their charge, and Courts there are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve both, as God's throne or court is to relieve Subjects.</p>
            <p>Hence likewiſe it is, that Princes are not to be reſiſted by Subjects, and both Philoſophical light and Politick ſerve to diſcern this as well as Divine light; for ſays moral Epictetus, <hi>We are not tyed to Parents and Governors, as they are good, but as they are Parents ana Governors;</hi> and deep ſighted Tacitus ſays, <hi>good Princes are to be wiſht and prayed for, bad</hi> (or whatever they proved) <hi>to be endured;</hi> and he gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; <hi>for ill Princes are to be endured as we do ſtorms and tempeſts,</hi> which are ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down upon us from above, or from Providence which hath an hand in giving, and an eye to obſerve, how we entertain his providences. Thus God required non-reſiſtance in order to Subjects own good; for anarchy was worſe than tyranny; and yet at the ſame time, if the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was immoral, he enjoyned non-obedience, that men might prefer the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal law, which flowed from Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before the poſitive or temporary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which flowed from mans unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs.</p>

            <p>Nor is a Prince leſs than his people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was truſted either by or for them, and even by Gods appointment is to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to them for their good; for the ſame reaſon would make Angels leſſer than men, becauſe Angels are Gods Miniſters for the good of men.</p>
            <p>However, primarily the Prince or State are truſted for the good of Subjects; for they are ſet over men, as the Sun is over the world, to enlighten and influence it, and they ſhall be accountable for it; but ſecondarily, they are intruſted to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the dignity and rights of their own Regal power, and not to let every humor of the people diſable them to govern, by pulling from them the feathers of their prerogatives.</p>
            <p>This ſubjection, which God requires, is no unreaſonable thing; for we perceive, it is but a ſuffering in matters of mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal concerns; for as hath been ſaid, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors authorities extend but unto mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43868:17"/> of an indifferent nature, and it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pride and impatience, which produce complaints. Which may appear by this, that moſt commonly, when the times are moſt plentiful, and the grievances very tolerable, then delicacy of ſenſe renders men moſt querulous, and their ſufferings are begot more from their inferences and reaſonings of what may follow, than what they feel; ſo as they muſt be beholding to their wit, before they can juſtifie their complaints. Reflect on the reign of Charles the Firſt, as I have impartially made ſome <hi>Memoires</hi> upon it, and this will be found true. Thus much for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of Government, and the non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Governors.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, Is it not more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to have a co-ordinate power joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that of the Prince?</p>
            <p>No ſure; for no Government can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a diſtinct equal power within it ſelf; for this is but like the doctrine of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm; for making many Gods and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soveraigns, are equally abſurd.<note place="margin">Co-ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> Co-ordination is like to prove the mother of a civil War.

So he or they remain abſolute, tho' limited; for thus as he or they cannot make laws without another, ſo no other body can make them without him or them. And when a law is made, it is made ſingly by the Prince, if it be in a Monarchy; or by the State, if it be in an Ariſtocracy; for a limited (which we call a mixt) Monarchy, or a mixt common-weal, is, in ſuch caſes, but like a man, that is bound, or a man that is ſleeping; he hath temporarily loſt his motion, but not his ſtrength; for as ſoon as he hath the concurrence of thoſe, whoſe conſent he ſtipulated to take, then he is unbound or awakened, and then he or they, not the Concurrers, are ſaid to act ſolely and ſoveraignly; for the power is virtually in his or their perſons in whom the ſoveraignty lies; for it is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs or the States affirmative voice, that makes the law or ſanction, though it is his or their negative voice, that rejects it. Thus the Soveraign Perſon or Perſons,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43868:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> is the ſingle ſoul of the law, and all this to avoid the ill conſequences of co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And hence it is, that the true Repreſentative of any people is the Prince in a Monarchy, or the States in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal; and from him or them there is no appeal but unto God, and wherever the laſt appeal is, there is the Soveraignty. And therefore the people abate of their own greatneſs, when they think any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them, but their Prince or State. Others may repreſent them, in order to repreſent their condition good or bad to the Prince, as a looking-glaſs doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the body to the heads view; but as bearing their image both at home and abroad, the Prince only repreſents the State of that people. An unequal league with the Foreigner takes not off ſupream power. Thucydides ſays, <hi>Colonies were as free as Mother cities, tho' not ſo reverently mentioned, becauſe of their dependence.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of paying tribute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that may be for redeeming an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or for ſome acknowledgment of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, but that paid, it is all that can be demanded. Neither is feudal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any deprivation of Soveraignty, ſince that is but a perſonal obligation or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but gives no right to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who is bound to this obſervance.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43868:19"/> Thus careful Civilians and Politicians are to keep Soveraignty ſacred, tho' by ſuch ties, as theſe, it may appear reſtrained.</p>
            <p>But leaſt ſome ſhould grumble at God for giving theſe great powers unto Princes and States, who are but frail men, in Gods behalf we will ſum up the reaſons uſually given for it. 1. God requires the Princes to rule for the good of their Subjects. 2. If they do not, he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces himſelf a Revenger. 3. He requires obedience and non-reſiſtance, to prevent Civil diſſentions, which are uſually worſe than tyranny; for Tyrants uſually extend not their oppreſſion upon a whole Nation, but upon ſome particular perſons they are diſpleaſed with, whilſt Civil war, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular commotions, ſpread over the whole land, and amongſt nigh Relations. And if Subjects may reſiſt for any one reaſon, from a parity of reaſon, which they will allege, they will never want a reaſon. 4. That God often experiments, whether Subjects will depend upon his promiſes, to reſtrain the fierceneſs of Princes, or on their own impatient humors and violences; or whether by an humble patience, they will wait his time for redreſs; ſince what men cannot reſiſt at one time, they find they may divert at another. 5. He ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects People to thoſe preſſures, becauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43868:19"/> they deſerve ſuch a ſcourge, as an ill Prince, for being themſelves ſo diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to himſelf; or, 6thly, becauſe very often they force a well natured Prince to be an ill one: as <hi>Boccalini</hi> ſays, the ſheep getting into their own mouths to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Shepherd the dogs teeth, or becauſe like the Neapolitan horſe, if they be well dreſt and fed, they will endure no Rider. Laſtly, becauſe a Princes tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can but reach unto the outward man, and to the outward things of the man, which Gods wiſe Providence in this world often expoſes to wean men from it, and to draw them to expect their ultimate happineſs or reſt in another World.</p>
            <p>Thus tho' a bad as well as a good Prince be thus ſecured by God,<note place="margin">To whoſe tribunal he ſtands bound.</note> God hath not aſſured him, but he will puniſh him, even by permitting an ill Spirit to riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and his People, and ſo it is Gods ſentence on the Prince, tho' a judgment or puniſhment on them both; on him, for violating the natural rights of his ſubjects,<note place="margin">Why God often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be rebellious.</note> and for breach of his obligation or oath unto them, that he would govern them by their laws, and be careful of them both in their lives and liberties. For, ſays <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calini,</hi> God made not Princes and Subjects as he did cats and mice, one to catch the other, and for a time to play with them,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43868:20"/> and then to eat them up; for natural, civil, and divine right, teaches the head to conſult for the good of the body, and the body readily to obey the head. In a word, tho' oppreſſion makes a wiſe man mad, yet no provocation can warrant a Chriſtian ſubject to be a rebel.</p>
            <p>Thus far we may ſay, this Queſtion about Government and the nature and end of Soveraignty, is examined ſingly by natural reaſon or reaſoning. Next, let us enquire after it by the word of God, and after that particularly by our own National laws.</p>

               <p>NO conſtitution of Government can be ſo happily framed,<note place="margin">Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Non-reſiſtance proved by Scripture.</note> as by its ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle fabrick, to ſecure the peace of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; elſe ſurely God's Theocracy among the Jews, and paternal Government among the Patriarchs, and Kings of Judah, would have prevented all complaints. When divine as well as prophane Hiſtory ſhall be conſulted, it will be found, Policy is like Morality, and may be much improved by theſe two words and precepts, <hi>Suſtinc &amp; abſtine.</hi> For the Prince muſt abſtain from violence and rapine, and neither for his pleaſures nor ambition, may he ſuffer himſelf to prey on his people. And often he muſt bear with, or ſuſtain their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or froward humors, leſt unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtirring them, he make a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he cannot quiet. And ſubjects will find, that the bleſſing of Government flows more from their paſſive obedience, than from any over nice care of their liberties;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43868:21"/> for <hi>impatience of Subjects has overthrown more States than the Tyranny of Princes,</hi> as will be toucht on hereafter; and moſt commonly <hi>God will not ſend a people good Governors, when they will not fit themſelves to bear ill ones.</hi> It was therefore not only the wiſdom, but the goodneſs of God towards Subjects, that he made Soveraign Perſons only anſwerable to himſelf. All other ways are (as Hoſea ſays) <hi>ſetting up of Kings, but not by him;</hi> or his Oeconomy pleaſes them not; and therefore they eat ſowre grapes (or frame to themſelves falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) and their teeth are ſet on edge, or they deſtroy the peace they hunt after; for the Politick body like the Natural, that will endure no ail, but have recourſe to phyſick, will ſoon purge it ſelf out of the world. But nothing of this, that is ſaid, infers, that men ſhould not defend the rights of free born Subjects, but that they defend them in their proper place or judicatures of the land, and not by the ſword.</p>
               <p>But he that gave a law to every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of creatures, gave one to mankind, which man leſs exactly obſerves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the freedom of his will, and by reaſon of his lapſt nature. But from the law of his nature, or from the Moral law, the beſt Judicial law is framed, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43868:21"/> may be found by obſerving, how this law among Gods own people, the Iſraelites, ſuits with the Moral law, given to, or for all Mankind; but at preſent we will extend this no further, than to perſons ruling or Legiſlators, and obſerve, what characters God in his Word puts upon them, and how he fences them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and how he ties all Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to them by obedience; for through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Scripture, Kings are ſaid not to reign over perſons but Nations; therefore called <hi>King of Iſrael, Judah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Head of the Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> ſo of all States under him.</p>
               <p>Scripture ſets forth,<note place="margin">Paternal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> how the firſt man was born under Government as God's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; how all his poſterity were under him, and conſequently how Paternal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was the original of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo all Mankind born under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and therefore the precept of honoring Fathers (or Parents) being a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precept, it is a proof, that Government is founded in nature, and was by extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not conſent. How paternal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ceaſt, hath been already ſet forth. Nimrod by Sir Water Rawleigh is eſteemed a <hi>Hunter</hi> or <hi>Uſurper,</hi> becauſe he took upon him the Government over others without their conſent or voluntary
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43868:22"/> ſubmiſſion or choice; not that he was an ill Prince.</p>
               <p>And in Scripture the ſanction or reward, that is propoſed for performing this duty, ſhews the benefit of obedience; for it is, <hi>that thy days may be long in the land, which the Lord thy God ſhall give thee;</hi> for obedience of inferiors (as hath been like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerved) is the moſt probable way to peace, and peace unto a Societies wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Hence it is, that men are ſo ſtrictly charged to reverence their Governors, and Governors to look upon themſelves as <hi>Miniſters of God for good,</hi> and as <hi>Revengers to execute wrath upon him that doth evil;</hi> ſo as his power muſt be no terror to good works, but employed for <hi>the good and praiſe</hi> (or encouragement) <hi>of thoſe that do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Governor was not a natural Father, to the end that he might not want natural affection unto his people, if the people wanted one, they were not to chooſe a Stranger; but ſuch a one, as Moſes and Joſhua, Samuel and Saul, and David, or whom God appointed. See Deut. 17. where the promiſe of a Prince and virtues of a Prince are ſet forth, and ſo Kingly rule a bleſſing, and promiſe of God to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the beginning.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:43868:22"/>
               <p>The Prince muſt have humility,<note place="margin">Scripture directions for a King.</note> that his heart be not lifted up above his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. He muſt <hi>not multiply to himſelf horſes,</hi> leaſt power incline him to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive. He muſt <hi>not give his ſtrength to women;</hi> for effeminacy abates courage and induſtry, and ſoftens and deſtroys him. And <hi>Solomon</hi> adds another caution, <hi>Let him not drink wine,</hi> (i. e. to exceſs) <hi>leſt he forget Gods law,</hi> or neglect Religion, <hi>and pervert judgment;</hi> for both theſe make him lither or wretchleſs, and unfit for the hardſhips and difficulties of Government. Nor muſt he <hi>encreaſe Riches,</hi> i. e. for his own private treaſure, or by the making his People miſerable and poor, make himſelf opulent, that he may the more ſecurely tyrannize. But rich he muſt be, ſince the ambition of Neighbours is at one time or another likely to diſturb his Peace; and ſince the conſtant charge, and contingent expences of Governors is like to be ſo great, therefore a full Exchequer becomes a good, as well as a wiſe and a politick Prince. Laſtly, Though human Policy muſt be uſed in human affairs, and that it appears too too hard, to expect the ſame ſtrictneſs of morality in a King's Office, which belongs to his perſons, as a man, (which is too hard a task for one no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter verſt in both theſe two Sciences than
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43868:23"/> my ſelf, to give the limits unto) this may be ſaid, that the Prince is obliged, ſince Politicks flow from Ethicks, as nigh as poſſibly he can, to ſuit his Policies with good Morals, or rather, that he frame them out of (at leaſt never contrary unto) the Word of God; for this will make him truly worſhip his God, and beſt teach him how to demean himſelf with men, or how to govern himſelf, either in relation to his forreign or home Affairs. Not that there are ſuch rules given in God's Word, but that <hi>a Prince's Policies ſhould not warrant any thing that Word forbids, but rather caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such delineations of a Prince, as theſe are, will convince men, that not only Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but Governors are the ordinance of God; for <hi>by me,</hi> ſays God, <hi>Kings raign,</hi> which Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges, when he ſays to Daniel, <hi>Your God is a God of Gods, and a Lord of Kings, and he rules in the Kingdoms of the earth, and gives it to whomſoever he will, and ſets up over it</hi> (i. e. whenever a people provoke him to ſend them that curſe) <hi>the baſeſt of men;</hi> or as Hoſea may ſeem to explain it, they caſt off his Government for Governments that men have framed, for, ſay they, <hi>give us a King like the other Nations,</hi> or let us caſt off King Charles the firſt for a Cromwell,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43868:23"/> or Chriſt for a Barrabbas. Thus people will ſometimes ſet up a King, but not by God; yea, and pull down a King to their own confuſion: which God divert them from doing any more.</p>
               <p>But that they may not thus miſchief themſelves, God's Word deſcribes a King's power by his character. <hi>A King, againſt whom there is no riſing.</hi> And what is ſaid of a King, is ſaid of all Soveraign Perſons, be they one or more, a Monarchy, or an Ariſtocracy, a Kingdom or a Common-weal; for if Subjects, upon diſcontents and diſſatisfactions, might change their ſetled form of Government, the politick Body, like his Natural, that is always giving Phyſick to himſelf, would be ſurely purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of its ſetled peace, and probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its grave: ſo as <hi>Solomon</hi> was very wiſe, and ſpake as well to the States of a Land, as unto particular perſons, when he ſaid, <hi>Meddle not with thoſe, who are given to change,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fear God</hi> therefore, and <hi>honour the King,</hi> and <hi>curſe not the King,</hi> i. e. ſpeak not evil of him, or in diſcourſe revile him. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, he is thy Politick Parent; go backward therefore, and cover his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Shimei's curſing was but revilings. Cut not off ſo much as the lap of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or approach him not with a prophane
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43868:24"/> tongue, or hand, as if he were not the Lord's Anointed, for he cannot be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that leſſens his dignity, or clouds his Majeſty. No, do not this <hi>in thine heart,</hi> or <hi>in thy bed-chamber;</hi> no, <hi>nor mingle with thoſe, that are given to changes;</hi> for <hi>their calamities ſhall riſe ſuddenly,</hi> or a <hi>Bird,</hi> ſome ſmall or unlook'd-for accident, ſhall betray thy conſpiracy, or, <hi>who knows the ruine of them?</hi> or it ſhall fall upon them by ſome providential accident, and their ruine ſhall be as ſwift, as their plots were ſecret: for if God's Word, in caſe of oppreſſion, direct men to cry unto him for relief, and not to cry, <hi>unto your Tents, O Iſrael;</hi> what is our reſiſtance, but to caſt off our dependance on God's providence, and to have recourſe unto the Witch of Endor, or our own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience: or like an injured man, that will not let the Judge give ſentence, nor the Hang-man execute him, that robb'd him, but he will do both offices himſelf? <hi>Rebellion therefore is like the ſin of Witchcraft:</hi> it removes its dependance on God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and flies, as has been ſaid, to an ill Spirit, or its own diſobedient and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive humor.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">There is no diſtinction between the King's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his power.</note>Nor muſt men ſubtilize by diſtinguiſhing betwixt the power and the perſon; for that Apoſtle, who ſays, <hi>Be not afraid of the Power,</hi> expounds it by the Perſon, <hi>for he is appointed

Thus a King's Perſon and his Power cannot be ſeparate, though they may be diſtinguiſhed; or his authority may be, where his Perſon is not, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his authority can be wanting, where his Perſon is.

               <p>Yet, as hath been obſerved before,<note place="margin">God, who is the ſingle puniſher of Prince's faults, yet permits as a ſcourge of his Subjects, and Subjects ſometimes to be a ſcourge to their Prince.</note> though God hath reſerved Princes for his own Tribunal, yet he hath ſhewn by ſeveral inſtances in Scripture, very particularly in that of Abimelech, and the men of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43868:25"/> Shechem, that he often makes Subjects (by permitting it, for it is ever evil in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) to become ſcourges to their Princes, and both to work each others ruine. As a ſcourge to David, he lets the greateſt part of Iſrael riſe againſt him, and follow his rebellious ſon Abſalom; and it was of the Lord, (by his permiſſion) that nine Tribes and a half forſook Rehoboam, and followed Jeroboam for Solomons ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43868:25"/> anſwer, Not, let us reſiſt, but, <hi>Pardon us in this, O king. Non eſt noſtri juris peccare, pati eſt. Tyrannus cum titulo</hi> is, or may be God's Anointed; <hi>Tyrannus ſine titulo</hi> is an Uſurper, and is to be looked on ſo, by all thoſe, who were born under, or had taken oaths of allegiance to a dethroned Prince. Thus Athaliah was deſtroyed to reſtore Joaſh, and perſonally Joaſh proved afterwards not much better than ſhe was; however, in him was preſerved the ſeed of David.</p>
               <p>Now Princes in their ſtate of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as our Prince in Parliament) are ſaid to be above the laws, becauſe they may change, abrogate, and diſpenſe with them, not, becauſe when it pleaſes them, they may violate them. If they judge the change conduces unto publick good, they are ſuperior to their laws: but if they remove a law to ſatisfie a paſſion, or take off a reſtraint from themſelves, or like Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, will be deifying themſelves, they may puniſh their Subjects for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying thoſe laws, but God will puniſh them, for abuſe of their office; and other remedy the Subjects, by the law of God, have none; but by the falſe reaſonings of a Junius Brutus, and a Buchanan, they have many. So as Subjects adventure not only their peace, but their ſalvation for their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43868:26"/> rebellion. Rebellion is not a ſingle ſin, but complicates them. It diſquiets a whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, makes great thoughts of heart; no man ſits under his own vine. It involves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in the miſery, tho' not in the guilt, and tyrannizes over Fellow-ſubjects, over whom they have no juſt power or right. The Ship-money, determined by law, (though probably with all its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not warranted ſo) was far from a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of arms; but rather than indure a Monopoly or a Loan, a Civil War muſt give licenſe for plunder unto the Soldiers of both parties. With ſo Chriſtian a King, as Charles the firſt was, had his two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes been of the ſame temper; or had they not had a malicious and ſhort-ſighted po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to alter the whole frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how eaſily, both before the war was begun, and after the ſword was blooded, might they have compoſed all things ſuitable to God's laws, and the laws of the Nation? But theſe men made themſelves Slaves to their Slaves, becauſe they would not be loyal Subjects to their Prince. It is one thing for a Senate (and certainly an honeſt one, and a dutiful one) to repreſent grievances, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Supplies upon no redreſs of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, (but there is nothing a grievance properly, which violates no law in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43868:26"/> but it is rebellion to take up Arms upon ſuch pretences.</p>

               <p>Sir Edward Coke obſerves by the laws of King Alfred, as well as by thoſe of the Conqueror, the ancient Kings, who were Saxons, had all the lands of England in demeaſnes; (<hi>Inſt.</hi> fol. 58.) and the Barons and Lords of Mannors were by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror enfeoft with all, which the King held not, but they held it for defence of the Realm under the King, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, they were to ſupport it in time of danger.

For every man is naturally bound with his All to defend the body Politick, and the conſtitution of the Government; tho' the quotum, and the manner of the raiſing it, had the Subjects conſent, that it might be the more equally laid, and the more cheerfully paid, and the more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly levied, and as an evidence, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was not deſpotical, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple free, and yet thus under ſubjection.</p>

Here, or with conſent of his Lords and Commons, he makes what laws he finds neceſſary for publick weal; which are the two great caſes, wherein Monarchical prerogative is limited; for lives and liberties are ſecured to Subjects by the Common and Statute Laws of the Realm; for we are a free People, or we know the Law we walk by. And yet in Parliament, (in matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the publick ſafety is concerned, or the Princes Perſon) a new Law may declare, that a treaſon, which before that new law was not ſo. But complication of Acts, which were known before, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of an inferior ſpecies to treaſon, before the making ſuch a law, cannot be made treaſon by that law, tho' the perſon for them may ſuffer as a Traytor.</p>
               <p>The great Act of Treaſon ſays, nothing ſhould be accounted treaſon, which was not therein particularly named; yet all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43868:31"/> this caution was to exclude inferior Courts from ſo denominating it, but not the King in Parliament. Indeed here prerogative is unlimited, becauſe here whatever is determined, may juſtly be ſuppoſed well weighed, and ſo provided, as it may not entrench upon liberty in general; tho' for example ſake, it fall ſevere on an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Perſon.

And here they may repreſent, what they ſuppoſe would tend to publick utility, ſubmitting it to the Royal pleaſure. In a word, the Houſes may propoſe, but it is the King, that determines; for he accepts or rejects, and what he accepts is only a law, and his

Nor can it be limited unto ſtrict forms or proceſs of Law; therefore ſay the Civilians, <hi>Jus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatum vocatur, quia reddendo cuique quod ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt verſatur, &amp; eo quod normae aequalitatis &amp; juſtitiae congruat.</hi> This therefore muſt be ſteddy and unalterable, and where it is ſo preſerved, Subjects are happy; for the known laws preſerve their own lives, liberties and properties;<note place="margin">Wherein preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed.</note> and the written and known laws are the Standards of all theſe.

And better men be terrified from coming nigh the bounds of this mount, than admitted with ſafety to approach it ſo nigh, that they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a hope to perfect that, which they would venture lives, and all they had, if they ſaw but a fair poſſibility to effect. Hence it is, that we ſay, <hi>Jus publicum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum convenientiam &amp; aptitudinem ſemper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit, ſed non ſemper aquitatem;</hi> but this is not to be wreſted, or made a patronage for any tyrannical action. Princes ought to be as morally juſt as private men, but under another law; for what will protect one, will not the other; reaſon of State ſhould never be made a pretence. Thus we ſee private Law moves by a ſtanding and formal rule of ſtrict juſtice, publick by a rule of reaſon and equity: neither by injuſtice, oppreſſion, or paſſion, or ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43868:34"/> or revenge againſt any particular man. In Subjects therefore, eſpecially in thoſe Repreſentatives of the Subjects in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, there ought not to be an indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to uphold the State and the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor: for attempts upon theſe are like ſome diſeaſes in the natural body, they muſt be early ſuſpected, and ſoon taken in hand; for if deferred untill an ordinary judgment can diſcern them, the wiſeſt Phyſician will not be able to cure them. Suetonius, in the life of Domitian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails Princes condition, <hi>Quibus de conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione comperta, non creditur niſi occiſis.</hi> A State may die of an apoplexy as well as a private man.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43868:34"/> who are apt to propoſe violent remedies, or make phyſick more pernicious than the diſeaſe; of whom it may be ſaid, as was ſaid of Sylla, <hi>Patriam durioribus remediis quam pericula erant ſanavit.</hi> Such men as theſe are apter to make remonſtrances to the People, than reaſonable repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a Prince. And our late Hiſtory of Charles the firſt will ſhew their temper; for they, even after they were victorious over the King, upon the ſtairs of their own Senate-houſe, wounded and bruiſed their Soldiers, many of their fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and thoſe who lived in their own quarters, for no other reaſon, than that they petitioned them to make a peace with him. Examine their own Records, what prerogatives theſe men uſed over their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects, and there will be little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to complain of the cruelty, even of a Henry 8. They that teach a multitude to reſort to their own ſtrength againſt their Prince, will live (as London did) to ſee their own cannon or ordnance by their own Army, turned upon themſelves, which they mounted to keep out their Prince. But this ſad example terrifies nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, not the one, from occaſions of jealouſie about religion or property, nor the other, from entertaining again the the ſpirit of ſchiſm and rebellion. But
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43868:35"/> ariſe, O Lord, and compoſe our diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus if you ask what is a wiſe man (or a people) without liberty, or <hi>quid Cato ſine libertate?</hi> You may live to anſwer, What is liberty without a Cato, or <hi>quid libertas ſine Catone.</hi> Tacitus makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Sect, who brought forth the <hi>Tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi> and the <hi>Favonians,</hi> unpleaſing names to the ancient Common-weal, who to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the State (ſays he) pretended Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; but if they had overthrown it, they would have given an aſſault to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown liberty likewiſe. And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in another place the good counſel of Sanguinius Maximus, a Conſul, who deſired the Senators not to encreaſe the Emperor's cares, by hunting after matters of diſlike. The wiſdom of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes it an axiome, <hi>The King can do no injury,</hi> therefore no provocation juſtifies force againſt him. His Miniſters are anſwerable to the laws; He is exempt, and all this for the Subjects peace. The ſtates of a land ſhould never repreſent the grievances of the land by Microſcopes; for ſuch magnifying glaſſes do but exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the humors of the whole body, and diſcourage the Prince from giving reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for when a Prince diſcerns a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuch a body not to miſunderſtand him, it is the beſt way to procure a good
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43868:35"/> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with him. Wiſe men ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the unavoidable errors or diſorders in their own families, before they ſhould aggravate or lay too naked (eſpecially to thoſe that cannot cure them) the failures of a Government. Nor is it excuſe for theſe <hi>Zealot-Stateſmen</hi> to ſay, they act with good intentions to the publick; for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of judgment may plead both with God and man for a mitigation of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the offence, but never for a juſtification of an evil or illegal act. Thus Nations are often overthrown by impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo dangerous is an overdoing Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: but a wiſe Senate makes a happy people, and a glorious Prince, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering States, like as they do men, or that they are beſt, not who have no failures, but who have feweſt.</p>
               <p>There are times, when men are more willing to caſt off the form of Government, than the Governor: and ſuch deſigns are with moſt difficulty withſtood.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee Government (or rather the juſtice of it) is founded upon the law of Nature, ſecured by the Word of God,<note place="margin">Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment how founded.</note> and defended by the Laws of the land. But we have a great Apoſtle of this Age,<note place="margin">Mr. Hobbs conſidered.</note> or a learned and ſtrong preſumptuous brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Leviathan,</hi> who not founding it upon nature, makes it ariſe from neceſſity and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43868:36"/> fear: thus making the Government and the Governor rather the brat of a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and frighted people, than the ordinance of God; ſo weakning the nature or ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Government, and yet one while making the Governor ſuch a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that no ſingle Perſon, or body of men, is to reſiſt him; for he ſo exalts him, that he may ſet up what Idol or vain opinions he will for a Religion, and all his Subjects are bound to entertain it, and no other: and no man upon any occaſion to riſe againſt him. And yet at laſt if they do, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail, he finds means to juſtifie them. Thus he can blow hot and cold, and we muſt all ſubmit to his dogma's, or be a fooliſh generation But many good pens have made remarks upon him, that were it not to frame a little Scheme, principally for my ſelf, I would not meddle with him at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How Mr. Hobbs makes the paſſions, and not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertues the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note>His Arguments run thus. Government aroſe upon neceſſity, and upon the fear one man had of another's power, every man by birth having an equal right unto every thing. So the natural condition of mankind was a State of war or hoſtility with one another. Now this is very ſtrange, that this learned man ſhould not conſider, if wolves and vultures (the fierceſt beaſts and birds of prey) will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43868:36"/> not act thus upon their own kind; if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (which we may believe is this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's God) framed theſe wild creatures calm to one another; how ſhe ſhould come to be ſuch a Step-dame to mankind. And if this Gentleman perceives man's ſoul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with moral virtues, as well as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſions, why ſhould he make Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ariſe from the concupiſcible paſſion of deſire, and the iraſcible of fear, and not from the cardinal virtues of prudence, temperance, juſtice and fortitude, with humanity and veracity? Do not theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral virtues evidence, that men were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only for a harmleſs, but a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Society? And doth not the neceſſity, which man hath of help, in relation to his body, ſhew he was not framed to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? And in relation to his mind, doth not temperance reſtrain deſire, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude repreſs fear? How doth temperance fit him to be contented with a little, and ſo make needleſs the invading the rights of others? How doth juſtice regulate his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards other men, and ſo ſecure them from any violence from Him? How doth humanity make him apt to relieve anothers neceſſities, as juſtice did to preſerve his rights? How doth his veracity ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in his converſation with him? Nor did art or policy beget theſe virtues in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43868:37"/> mankind or nature, but a God of nature implanted it in humane nature. And can this Gentleman believe, that the diſorders that flowed from injuſtice, were the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of juſtice? though it was often the mother of good civil laws againſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularized acts of injuſtice. Injuſtice would not have been perceived, but as it was a deflection from natural juſtice; or why doth he ſay, every man naturally, upon the fear he had of every other man, was againſt every other man? which made it reaſonable for every man to ſecure himſelf by way of anticipation (i. e. as I conceive, without any other provocation or injury, but his own fear) by force and wiles to maſter all others, till he ſaw no other power great enough to endanger him. His Maſter <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſets forth much of this, but allows not the practice. If this be not prodigy, I know not what is; for if this be true, we will repeat it again. What a ſtep-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Nature, (for we will not now talk of a God, or intelligent mind diſtinct from, and antecedent to all viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or of inviſible powers, which ſeem to him but as ſcarr-crows ſet up to fright fearful and ignorant men) who made this kind of creature, Man, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, by its, primier deſignation and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43868:37"/> yet by or upon experience of his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,<note place="margin">If Mr. Hobbs way of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this queſtion be true, the creature is wiſer than the Creator.</note> how came a man reaſonable enough by law and penalties to find a means lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in himſelf to divert the evil, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſubjected him unto. Thus the effect ſeems ſuperior to the cauſe; for if man can thus excel his own nature, how comes it about, that other creatures cannot do the like? or how comes man to be wiſer by ſubmitting his own underſtanding and ſtrength to a Governors, to provide better for himſelf than Nature did? Did Nature produce him to a ſtate of war, and he find out the benefit of Society in peace? Pray then, why ſhould not a horſe do the like, and find he was turned out of the orchyard, where was long graſs, into the barren Common, for cropping the trees? Or why ſhould not bees and waſps make leagues together, and one give ſome of their honey to avoid hoſtility? By all this we ſee how fatal it is for men of ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts and good literature, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain falſe principles; and how falſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about Nature produce falſer about po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. Judge Hales hath convinced this Gentleman in his Origination of Mankind in point of natural Philoſophy; and the Lord Chancellor Hyde hath done it as well about his Politicks; and Dr. Parker in his Eccleſiaſtical Policy, hath ſhewed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43868:38"/> the abſurdity of this Gentleman's opinion about Religion and Civil Policy; and therefore I will rather give men warning of him than enter farther the liſts; or I would not farther fall upon one, whom ſo many others have attackt ſo maſterfully, and with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>God made Government his own ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and made Governors owe their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to him; for it is <hi>by him that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reign;</hi> for <hi>Promotion neither comes from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, for it is God that ſets up one, and pulls down another.</hi> He cloathed them with power and majeſty,<note place="margin">God veſted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with power and majeſty.</note> as the neceſſary ſupports of all Government; for without theſe no perſonal virtues of the Prince would be able to ſupport him, or with a heady and miſtaking multitude to gain that obedience, which Government cannot be without.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Power.</note>Power therefore is ſingly lodged in him, (or them,) in whom the Soveraignty is lodged. And if there be no Soveraignty, or a power, from which there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, there is no Government; for the rights of Soveraignty muſt be uncontroulable. If God himſelf were not omnipotent, men would not be guided by his wiſdom; for we ſee men queſtioning his decrees every day, not content with his juſtice; for how many diſreliſh his determination of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43868:38"/> evil Governors, tho' it were made in behalf of themſelves, as the beſt means to ſecure their common peace and publick intereſt? A great part of the office of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor is to reward and puniſh; yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if power fenced it not, every one would ſhare with his Prince, or diſpenſe theſe themſelves, and become Judges, or give ſentence (nay be Executioners too) in their own caſes. Where rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not well diſpens'd, loyalty and faithfulneſs will both quit a Court. And Boccalini makes thoſe virtues rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to a Dog-kennel, than return thither; for that creature, ſays he, hath ſome gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and ſenſe of being well uſed; and therefore theſe virtues quitted the Court, and went thither. Thus the diſpenſing rewards and puniſhments being ſo eminent a branch of a Princes power, he ſhould truſt it in no hand to diſtribute but his own. All natures, (but Gods) wanting ſomewhat, are moved or attracted by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and deterred by puniſhments; for puniſhments were added unto laws, that whom conſcience would not reſtrain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pain and loſs might.</p>
               <p>Multitude of ſubjects in ſome one, or ſome nigh Countries, is a foundation of greater greatneſs than largeneſs of diſperſt dominion. This hath enabled France to ruin Spain.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Majeſty.</note>Majeſty is but the glory of power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, or it is a reſult of the amplitude of greatneſs, directed to bring awe and reverence towards authority; for Majeſty is but a ſeeming pageantry, when power upholds it not, and where every one can approach it without reſpect; for, ſays the Politicians, <hi>Majeſtas major é longinquo;</hi> for when a Prince by ſome unſeeming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of ſome Favorite abates or lets fall his own Majeſty, every one that thinks as well of himſelf, as the Prince doth of the Favorite, forgets duty and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſawcy. And thus when a Prince abates of the reverence, which ought to be paid to his perſon, he ſeldom finds it paid unto his affairs. It is good for a Prince, by a reputation of mildneſs lodged in him, rather by his diſcretion, than natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to abate in his ſubjects in general the fear of his power; for that will be thought the juſter, when he is ſharp upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, that demerits; but to let fall his Majeſty, warrants low thoughts of him among the generality. Thus Princes, tho' as men, they muſt live as men; yet by reaſon of the dignity of their office, they muſt either abſtain from, or uſe theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities in private, or be prejudiced in their regal ſtation. And the perſon, to whom the Prince communicates theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43868:39"/> if he be either vain or inſolent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, (which is a hard task not to be) he draws upon himſelf an inſupportable envy, and on his Maſters reputation a great diminution.</p>
               <p>The full glory of a Nation (or its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty) is drawn, as in a burning glaſs,<note place="margin">The Prince the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a Nation.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one point, in the perſon of the King; and therefore if he let it fall himſelf, or any ſubject by abuſe of his favour darken it, it is an offence againſt the publick.</p>
               <p>The office of a King or ſupream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is to govern multitudes of people; and they are heady, refractory, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady, like horſes, apt to be reſty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they find their Rider faſt in the ſaddle, and themſelves commanded by the bit and ſpur, or under a power;<note place="margin">How his power and majeſty are neceſſary.</note> and thus power is neceſſary. And common people like children, are delighted with glorious and gay things; and thus Majeſty is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo as the reverence of civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is upheld much by the ſplendor of Majeſty; for without this popular fancy will not be pleaſed nor ſatisfied; for which reaſon greatneſs ever ſtands in need of ſome ſenſible luſtre. Thus, as there is a real neceſſity of power, ſo conſidering how ſtrong fancy is in multitudes, there is a neceſſity, that Majeſty be as little neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as Power.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Piety.</note>Piety leads a Prince to believe, that he is accountable unto God for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his high office, and it leads the ſubject to believe, that that prince, who acknowledges a greater power than his own, and that a divine power, is like to uſe his own unto good ends. It bows his own heart unto God, and his ſubjects unto himſelf; or it diſpoſes him to live well, and his ſubjects to obey willingly. It makes him watchful in the diſcharge of his own office, and reſolute againſt thoſe, who invade him in it. It is the beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectreſs both of his Power and Majeſty; for it keeps power from cruelty, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty from diſdaining of others. It makes a Prince value the divine Providence, that watches over him more than his Guards; knowing, without this, civil wiſdom or military power very often miſcarry. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the vices of Princes always turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own puniſhment; for they, that imitate them in their vice, are apteſt to diſquiet them in their Government; and thus they diſhearten good ſubjects to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, and encourage ill to rebel againſt themſelves.</p>

Men entred into Society, that they might enjoy the benefit of it; and when it is obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Common-weal is ſick, if generally not adminiſtred, the band of Society is diſſolved: the execution of it is the life of the laws. No arbitrary power, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, or reaſon of ſtate muſt want juſtice, for the ſtanding laws, and the arbitrary determinations of Soveraignty muſt both be reaſonable and juſt; the one may want the formalities or forms of proceſs, which the other is tyed unto; but juſtice muſt be the life and ſpirit of them both. And therefore they are narrow thoughts, that think, what is arbitrary is unjuſt; for when it is the determination of a good and a wiſe man, it is very often more perfect than the law it ſelf, becauſe made a rule after the inconvenience of the law is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; or wiſe men would make it a law, or give it a ſanction as ſoon as propoſed. So as I ever thought the binding the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or their binding themſelves too ſtrictly unto the letter of the law, and formality of words, and ſpellings, in pleadings, was like ſtrait ligatures, which hinder juſt circulation of humors; for it is one thing

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43868:42"/> in ſpeech, or diverſion in diſcourſe, which otherwiſe would diſcloſe a meaning too ſoon, a ſpeaking that for his own opinion, which he avers not to be his Maſter's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, a ſubtilty of extracting the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thoughts, and yet concealing his own, to be cautious in the beginning of a Treaty, ſo he be ſincere and open in the concluſion of it; all theſe are ſeemly in an Ambaſſador, which would be very blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among private men, eſpecially Friends. <hi>The beſt compoſition,</hi> ſays a great man, is <hi>openneſs in fame, ſecrecy in habit; for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as little becomes a mind, as a body.</hi> Hiſtories and Civilians give greater latitude unto Princes to diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the obligation of their Treaties than exact Morality will allow of. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſeveral inſtances in Dr. Zouch's writings, and particularly of Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabeth, who ſaid plainly, ſhe meant ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when ſhe treated; but having promiſed an aſſiſtance, further than would ſtand with her own treaſure and her Peoples ſafety, ſhe could not bind her ſelf unto the extremity of her Articles. She was ready to ſhew, ſhe meant not in her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deceive, nor did ſhe then, to bear the ill conſequences, which ſhe now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. This I relate, this I juſtifie not; but if frequent examples do juſtifie it, then
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43868:42"/> we may ſay, Princes are not deceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they expect not the exactneſs of private men, whoſe damages reach further than their Perſons or private concern. And in Treaties it is now ſometimes made an article to make a retrait upon ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.</p>
               <p>Clemency is a chief part of humanity,<note place="margin">Clemency.</note> and ſhould ever be found in a Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt men at one time or other ſtand in need of a Prince's goodneſs. But to make it valuable, this virtue ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from generoſity, not facility of his nature. And he muſt be careful, that his natural good temper, no, nor his moral clemency, appear to take off the terror of his politick juſtice. His clemency will ſufficiently appear, if it reſtrain him from frequent ſeverities: for it is neither for the honor of the Prince, nor the Phyſician, when their Patients are ſent in numbers to the burial-places. Clemency withſtands not ſeverity, though ſhe endeavors to uſe it ſeldom; for a Prince may be very cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his diſpoſition, nay, in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and uſual practice, and yet be very ſevere upon provocations, that warrant the ſame; for ſuch a well uſed ſeverity the better illuſtrates his clemency. But it is much better for a Prince to pardon an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt his Perſon, than againſt his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43868:43"/> Government, or againſt a private Subject's intereſt or right And nothing can worſe become a Prince's bounty or clemency than to grant pardons to offenders, as dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives or rewards to Servants. It is much better to give them the forfeiture of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender's eſtate, for that is an Eſcheat to himſelf, than a pardon to the Offender, for that is a ſelling of juſtice. A pardon is fit not to be given at all, or to be done freely, that ſo it may be a real act of clemency, and make the Offender grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or upon a ſecond fault more guilty.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Modeſty.</note>Modeſty is a virtue of ſo mean a ſound, that it may ſeem derogatory to attribute it unto a Prince, but if well interpreted, it is a flower in his Crown; for it is a high ſpirited virtue, tempering greatneſs or power towards men of inferiour conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or it is a generous diſpoſition in a Prince, not to dazle a private man with the glory of his Majeſty, nor to create in him fear by the terror of his power. So it muſt needs be attractive both of love and reverence, rendring the Prince acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and making him unapt to put a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or affront upon the meaneſt man; ſince the meaneſt may do the greateſt a ſhrewd turn; for <hi>nihil tam firmum eſt, cui periculum non ſit etiam ab invalido.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, Modeſty is a great antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt flattery, the common bane of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the flattery, that is made unto their buſineſs and affairs, is often greater and more pernicious than that which is made unto their Perſons; for the one is but ſcratching an itch of a prurient temper or blood, but the other is endangering the publick peace or ſecurity. Flattery of a Prince's Perſon is but like a painted flower, that pleaſes the eye, but offends the ſmell; but flattery of his buſineſs is like a chymical vapor, that ſtupifies the brain. But in both kinds Princes love to draw it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for ſuch as ſeem to admire their perſons, and applaud or concur in their counſels, they take to be their friends; and the reaſon of it is, they love rather to have their hopes fortified, than their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers awak't; for they affect to cheriſh hope, and ſtifle fear, and are not patient of deliberating or examining a matter by contrary judgments, or of men of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conceptions, or divers tempers and educations or intereſts; for oppoſite opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are like the teeth of a file, it muſt ſcrape off, before it can ſmooth an affair, whilſt ſeveral concording judgments too often make an affair pleaſant and hopeful in the beginning, though more commonly irkſome and ſhameful ar the latter end of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43868:44"/> it. Xerxes never knew the value of his Councellor Demaratus, until he had made his ſhameful retreat out of Greece: then he found what the other had told him, that there was much difference between a great multitude and a well diſciplined ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whether it were to ſight or to ſubſiſt; and then he knew the accidents, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon the one, in marching through ſtraights, and finding proviſion, and the uſefulneſs and ſervices of the other. And for the honor of this great King it is, that he valued this ſingle man, more than he did all his other Councellors, when he returned home. But when obſervations of this kind are never ſo much multiplied, Princes Courts will never be cured of this King's-evil, but will favour thoſe, who counſel towards what they love, and never have in eſteem thoſe, who by projecting the worſt, and by foreſeeing ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or cautioning againſt dangers, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they love their Maſter's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and ſucceſs in affairs, better than they do their own preferments. Fot flattery is the beſt Court-picklock, and plainneſs of ſpeech the ſureſt bar againſt a man's own preferment. Modeſty hath this farther good operation upon a Prince, that it minds him of the incertainty of events in the beſt lay'd and proſecuted deſigns;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43868:44"/> there being a common viciſſitude or change of fortune, which wiſe men, like Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, will diſcern and laugh at even in their captivity, becauſe thereby they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, <hi>quam caduca ſit felicitas humana,</hi> as Curtius expreſſes it, or how fading and falling a leaf proſperity is.</p>
               <p>Liberality or bounty is much cry'd up in a Prince,<note place="margin">Liberality</note> and is very becoming great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Majeſty; for men would not love the ſun or heavenly bodies for their own glory and heat, if they conveyed not unto them and other creatures cheering light and benign influence. But it requires pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a high meaſure to guide it; for if it run into the intrinſick eſtate of a Prince, or make him poor, that others may be vainly rich, it diſcredits him more, than it honors him, and looſes its name, for 'tis termed prodigality. Even he, that is benefitted by it, deſpiſes him for it, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather on it as a weakneſs of mind than a greatneſs. And it obliges unto no thankfulneſs, if what is looſely or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately given, obliges to ſuch expences or ſplendid courſe of life, (which ſome Princes affect from thoſe they are thus bountiful unto) that they can lay up no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for themſelves and children. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney being like meat; if a man muſt eat or ſwallow till he regorge it, he will find a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43868:45"/> Philoſopher's ſupper better than a Prince's feaſt. If Favorites of pleaſure be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of bounty, then the Subjects ſhut their purſe from ſupplying him, who feeds ſo many vermin, and on whom ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min hang. Let their food be never ſo good, their mein or countenance never is florid; or if exceſſive bounty unto ſome few make Servants looſe their ſmall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wages, or diets, it aliens the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and chils the duty of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many attendants towards their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Indeed bounty unto ſuch men ſhould be only waſt water; when the Exchequer can ſupply the ordinary expences, bounty is then and not until then ſeemly. Nor ſhould bounty unto Favorites, or expences of pleaſure deprive deſerving Servants or Subjects of rewards, ſuch as have merited of the State in home or foraign affairs; for for theſe a Prince may laudably appear rather poor than not bountiful. Yet for theſe he muſt not weaken the publick revenue, which in all Nations is reputed Sacred. But the caſual revenue, and the offices in the gift of the Crown, the leaſes even of the Demeaſnes, and things of this nature are wiſely here diſpoſed: but giving honors and eſtates in perpetuity, if any one made his reflexions, how many Noble families owed both to the Crown,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43868:45"/> and yet in this laſt age have contributed much to pull it down, one would put no great price upon gratitude, or Princes might well think it fit, to put ſome new rules unto their bounties. Rewards unto ſome perſons, which far exceed the merit of the perſon, makes others much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value what they receive, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with an overmeaſure. And if their reward come unto them more from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of a great man, than the Prince's own diſpoſition, the former will have the thanks: and thus a Prince buys but a Servant for a great man. Sir Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Digges in his Preface to Secretary Walſingham's Letters obſerves, that Queen Eliſabeth was better ſerved for a Penſion of forty pounds per annum, than King James for an annuity of four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Frugality in a Prince is an univerſal bounty to all his People;<note place="margin">Frugality.</note> for it enables a Prince to live without, or at leaſt to crave leſs aids, and a Prince's care to promote trade, manufactures, husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or prevent confederacy among men of a trade, as Graſiers, Butchers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, who ſet the price or dice, as we call it, upon all buyers, is to be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong bounties, which reach unto the whole body of the People. So as the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43868:46"/> Kingly Office is an inſtrument of bounty and of frugality both; for by one and the ſame means he inriches his People, and ſaves his own treaſure. Men of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are leaſt preſt upon, for no man judges better, when, and unto whom it is fit to give, than that Prince, that ſeeks to make his People rich rather by his providence, and by their own induſtries and frugalities, than by his coffers; for it is a very ill ſymptom in a State, when every broken fortune hopes to make it ſelf up from a King's Exchequer. Thus frugality is a key unto the Subjects treaſure; for the people willingly lend the key of theirs unto a Prince, that keeps the lock of his own: and as unwillingly to one, who ſpends upon his Favorites what is his own, or what his Subjects ſupply him with; ſince the humor of ſuch times and expences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Country, as well as the Court, and ſo they will rail againſt the vices, that are ſo coſtly unto them, though they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them. And if ſuch an expenſiveneſs lead towards a general poverty, it will in a ſhort time draw on a general defection.</p>
               <p>Yet Courts muſt not want their ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor: for that is a part of the Prince's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the very ſilks and fine linnen of it, the back and the board of a few Courtiers feed the belly, and ſet on work
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43868:46"/> the hands of many Vulgars. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be impolitick in the Emperor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian (and accordingly complained of) that he affected to appear in his Court more a Philoſopher than a Prince, baniſhing the Officers of ſhews and vanity, and of Cooks and Barbers and Taylors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Love of fame was implanted in men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end they might love virtue;<note place="margin">Love of Fame.</note> ſince there is no greater evidence than that where the one is deſpiſed, the other is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; for though the perſon of the man in a ſhort time will be forgot, his deeds with reflection on him will be remembred. Hence it is too many men had rather wound their conſciences than their fame; yet many make it the cheapeſt thing they are concerned in. Neglect of fame begets remiſſneſs in Government; for <hi>he that cares little, how men look upon him, cares leſs what he doth:</hi> ſays that witty and pleaſant, and yet often ſerious Spaniard, Quevedo; if Chriſt himſelf thought fit to ask his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>what ſay men of me?</hi> nay, unto his Apoſtle St. Peter, <hi>what ſay you of me?</hi> it may become the wiſdom of the greateſt Prince to make the ſame enquiries. It is diſagreeable unto nature to be unconcern'd in fame; ſince the God of nature made it a reſtraint upon a vicious courſe of life, or a means to keep men out of bad company,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43868:47"/> out of thoſe courſes, which expoſe him to be undervalued; for not only looſneſs of life, but remiſſneſs in affairs, or raſh entering upon important actions, and faintly proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, or uncertainty of mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs of councels (all which uſually are attended with unſucceſsfulneſs) draw down infamy upon a great man. And when a Prince hath loſt the inward reverence, which is due unto the generoſity of his mind, the outward, which is paid unto his perſon, will ſoon appear a ſhadow, which forſakes the dyal with the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine. It is unlooſing the girdle of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>(ſolvere cingulum regum)</hi> to withdraw an inward eſteem from a Prince. Shall jealouſie of a Subject's reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken a Prince? Shall he think it his concern, that this man be not overprized, and yet be unconcerned, that he himſelf is reputed no way valuable? Since no men are concerned for a Prince they value not, how inſecure doth contempt of Fame ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him?</p>
               <p>Yet Princes or Great men are not to think a laſting fame is a good fame; ſince the word <hi>Famous</hi> is an equivocal word, and men may be famous for bad as well as good actions. Judas is as well record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as St. Peter, and Heroſtratus, who burnt Diana's Temple only to keep up his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43868:47"/> name, loſt his eſteem among men, and had almoſt loſt his name likewiſe, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the great, and Julius Caeſar, and the great and proſperous neighbour Prince of our times affected fame, but they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it not; for her Trumpet ſounds and recommends heroick, noble, and virtuous actions, or actions, that benefited mankind, not ſuch, whoſe effects and proſperity, were only like a ſtorm at ſea, or a plaguy year, which are regiſtred in the Kalendar, for the deſtruction they made and the harm they did. How much more hath a private man to thank God for, that he made him an inſtrument of a little good unto a few men, than the greateſt Prince in the world hath, that he was an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Peſt, and that upon his own choice. The folly of ſuch a conceit appears in this, that he thinks he ſhall preſerve the memory of his perſon (unto which he is fondly indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent) by it; when fame reaches (as that great Boethius ſays) no farther than unto his actions: ſo as if they be not beautiful and ſhapely, though he were another Abſalom, fame will but ſet him out as a Traytor. Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calini hath a good repreſentation of the ſhame and infamy of black ſucceſsful deeds, when he repreſents Duke Sforza of Milan demanding a triumph of Apollo, and it being granted him upon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43868:48"/> that the families he had unjuſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and tyrannically ruined, ſhould be placed about the wheels of his Chariot, the ſhame thereof cured this itch of vanity, and he declined his triumph, that he might conceal the way or means, that enabled him to pretend unto it. This may be a true reaſon, why God removed the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mens perſons from fame, and by it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved only their actions; for it was the virtues of the mind, which he took care to recommend to poſterity, and he deſigned nothing to be memorable and renowned, but what was fit to be imitated. So as fame, by God's appointment, was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the memory of his great and good deeds, unto whoſe perſon God deſigned a reward from himſelf in another world, if not in this likewiſe. And yet a good fame makes a man live after his death; for the honor other men pay unto his memory, whoſe perſon they have no notion of, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him to them, as if he was ſtill a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing example of virtue. The appetite of honor is rooted even in nature it ſelf, and therefore if men be careful, how they get it, they may be ſollicitous to get it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alive and dead it benefits others as well as themſelves, and becauſe it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that thoſe men, who care not what others think of them, care as little what they do themſelves.</p>

               <p>Prudence is a Prince's Maſter-virtue,<note place="margin">Prudence.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a private man's chief honor. In all Civil, Military, and Eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs it is the great directreſs.

               </p>
               <p>It is the diſtraction of a man's mind, that he hath ſo many ſeveral repreſentations of one and the ſame thing, like a picture if he look upon it by one light, it ſeems one thing unto him, if by another light, it ſeems to vary its figure. In its ſelf an affair may be one thing, but cloathed in its various circumſtances it is another: ſo as many ways ſeem to lead unto it, and yet really there is but one: and this path Prudence only can walk in; for the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, like the Chymiſt, can ſeparate bodies, that are mixt and incorporate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and which are indiſcernible unto a vulgar eye. In Civil affairs, he is the beſt Chymiſt, who hath moſt experience; for though men may be ingenious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, yet ſeldom ſolid or expedite, and yet all the ſciences ſerve him much; for the prudent Prince will ſtand in need of natural Philoſophy, to judge of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitutions and tempers of men, as well as moral, to know how to improve,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43868:49"/> govern, or reſtrain the tempers of thoſe, whom he truſts with his affairs; elſe an impetuoſity of temper will blind reaſon, and tranſport him, who diſcerns his own infirmities, and yet hath not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to bridle them. An eloquent and deſigning man will be followed by multitudes, when a ſober and well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgment will too often want a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. A prudent man is apter to ſuſpect his own advice, than another man's, of whoſe integrity he is ſatisfied; ſince he may with reaſon ſuſpect his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe every one needs to ſee his own thoughts through ſome other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, than his own way of reaſoning; the phanſie and the judgment being too nigh of kin to be ſevere upon each other. Which made Balſac determine, that it was too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ſhame and reproach of human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that the greateſt minds, being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left unto themſelves, in the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were likelieſt to commit the greateſt errors. And therefore the prudent man is far from being an overweaning or overcau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man, and thus prudence recommends modeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Choice of Officers.</note>Nothing therefore more manifeſts the prudence of a Prince than the choice of his Councellors and ſubordinate Miniſters of State, and Domeſtick Servants and Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43868:49"/> for the office of the Prince is well performed in his Perſon, when he hath choſen good Miniſters and Servants; for as hath been ſaid already, He is not the worſt Prince, who is the worſt man, but he that hath the worſt inſtruments to work by; for the tools uſually ſhew the artiſt. For a Prince for money or favor to bring undeſerving men into offices of great truſt, is to gratifie the deſire of his enemies; for they wiſh nothing more.</p>
               <p>It is a great evidence of a Prince's own abilities to be able to chooſe a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and of his virtue,<note place="margin">Of choice of Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors about a Prince.</note> not to render ſuch a Counſellor uſeleſs unto himſelf; for he that will receive Counſel, muſt have no pretincture or preingagement, or no bias, which may draw him off from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is ſaid unto him. He muſt have no petty Counſellors or Favorites of pleaſure, to ſtagger his reſolutions by whiſpers. He muſt ſhut his ears unto flatterers; for if he once believe that ſort of men in what they ſay in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf, he will ſoon believe them in what they ſay againſt others.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43868:50"/> what you ſay now.</hi> And Ariſtotle's epiſtle unto Alexander is moſt remarkable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he told him, <hi>he was moſt glad to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he was not, as too many Princes were, ſo ſcornful and ſo unreaſonable, as to make good advice ridiculous.</hi> This was worthy of ſo great a man's taking notice of; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing makes ſerious men ſooner deſert a Prince's intereſt, than to be under a ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed character; for Cicero in his Offices ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>many men will loſe their lives for a Prince, who will not loſe their reputations.</hi> I once heard theſe Buffoons, that thus pleaſed a Prince, called by a ſerious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>the Petards of a Court; for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>by repreſenting any man in a diſguiſe or maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade, they will blow up his credit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Prince have a known bias, he will too ſoon be obſerved, and a common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding at Court will make that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wiſdom, which really is but flattery; for there is ſcarce any one maxim in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which is not combated by ſome other; therefore they that ſtudy their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment or ſecurity, not their Princes eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment or honor, will ſoon find, that the weaker reaſon, that gratifies the ſtronger paſſion of a Prince, is ever accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and rewarded; whilſt the ſtronger reaſon is miſ-interpreted as a diſaffection.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43868:50"/> Princes therefore muſt diſcountenance no man's advice: for a wife Prince, like a good Huntſman, muſt encourage the dog, that hunts for the ſents, as well as he that hits it. And Counſel, that is ſincere, muſt be grateful, and the Counſellor if he ſpeak in private, his Counſel muſt be kept private: for if the Prince expoſe him unto a contrary faction, it will create that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he will want freedom of advice, when the other wants his ſecurity in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing. Thus Princes muſt not call their Counſellors to adviſe, as Xerxes did, and then tell them, <hi>he called them to bring obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent minds, not troubleſome debates.</hi> And if a Prince would be well adviſed, he muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe early; for there is no comfort to ſay, Sir, the time is paſt, or it is too late now to think on it. A Prince ſhould have no Councellor to be ſo mean, as to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto him, nor ſo lofty, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him; for the very errors of a Prince are to be concealed, or reſpectfully laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before him, and to be, as much as may be, concealed from others.</p>
               <p>My Lord Bacon ſays, <hi>a Prince ſhould have but few, and thoſe well choſen Counſellors, that they may carry on his buſineſs with one ſpirit of direction;</hi> therefore he obſerves wiſe Henry the ſeventh made uſe only of Biſhop Morton and Biſhop Fox. Over

He may keep his ear open unto many, but he muſt not let them run into factions againſt one another, if he hope to be ſerved by any; for they will reak their ſpight againſt one another at the price of his diſſervice. If both concur not in his buſineſs, he deceives himſelf, if he thinks he hath uſe of either. If he carry himſelf with indifference unto their particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, he may make uſe both of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and intereſt unto his own ſervice. And any other way of managing factions, or keeping them at odds, unto my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, was never uſeful unto any Prince. If either of them have a predominancy with him, at leaſt ſo by turns, as one checks the other, both diſſerve him.</p>
               <p>The beſt way of a Prince to know the nature of him he would make a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of, is to know him by domeſticks, and neighbours, and general vogue; for from theſe no man can long conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or his natural inclinations. Enemies will traduce him, friends over value him; but theſe (if what they ſay flow naturally from themſelves) beſt diſcover him. And the Counſellor's nature is as much to be conſidered, as his abilities: for though Princes moſt commonly beſt eſteem of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43868:51"/> ſubtil men, it is moral good men, who beſt advance their ſervice; for a mind not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with morality, like the delicateſt wines, will beſt pleaſe the taſte for a time, but ſoon grow prickt or ſowre, or ſome trick they will play at laſt, harms more than any of their ſervices do good.</p>
               <p>When piety therefore is joyned unto natural abilities, ripeneſs of age,<note place="margin">Characters of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</note> and good experience, (as early having entred into buſineſs) then a Prince may expect not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an able, but a faithful Councellor. If piety be wanting, abilities will turn but unto compliances, and ſelf-ends, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome faction rather than the Prince; for moral virtue is the only reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſelf-intereſt. Abilities deſtitute of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeldom advance a Princes ſervice, and he is likelieſt beſt to ſerve his Prince on earth, who ſerves his God in heaven; for piety only can reſtrain the ill effects of ambition or covetouſneſs, or lead a man to prefer his maſters ſervice, more than any proviſion for wiſe or children. It is the honour of Cardinal Toledo, that he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be of the Kings Council, without he might declare Gods will in oppoſition unto the impiety of modern policies. Without natural abilities in a Councellor, men expect a harveſt, without having ſowed the field; or if it were ſowed, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43868:52"/> the ſeed corn not good, (viz. ſowed with principles Epicurean, Machiavilian, or Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian they will never ſerve to govern a free peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e; they may to render men ſlaves. If Councellors be not grave and aged perſons, they that are to obey their counſels will not reverence them, or cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmit; for young men muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily want experience, and without experience the beſt abilities will be ſubject unto groſs errors. A Stateſman, or indeed, any man in any courſe of life, muſt be broken unto buſineſs <hi>(rompu aux affaires)</hi> before any other man can confidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him; for he is not to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to guide an affair, that hath not ſeen both ſides of fortune, or met with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſters as well as good ſucceſſes, or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them carefully in Hiſtory. When young men give the counſel, the matter of it is moſt commonly violent; for their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per leads either unto raſh and daring things, ſuch as may endanger the ſettlement of the preſent ſtate, (which no wiſe Prince for increaſe of juriſdiction or prerogative ſhould ever adventure) or unto wit and repartees, which are proper for diſcourſes at a table, but not for the gravity of a Council-board: for commonly they gain their eſteem by judgments they make on things paſt, or by reflections on an affair in general, not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43868:52"/> by councils or determinations on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is preſent and particular. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is a great miſtake to think men of wit, with ſome mixture of Latin and Greek, or foreign languages, make the propereſt perſons for buſineſs. A great man both of wit and learning, Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, determines againſt it, <hi>Hebetiores, quam viri acutiores, melius Rem-publ. adminiſtrant.</hi> Young and witty men have too much fancy to examine their own judgments, and their warm temper makes them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute an affair with eagerneſs at firſt, and remiſneſs towards the end, <hi>acribus initiis, ſed incurioſo fine,</hi> and they are too likely raſhly to run into errors, and by unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable remedies to endeavour their cure, or <hi>intempeſtivis remediis delicta accendunt.</hi> I uſe the Authors words, (tho' the method of writing be out of faſhion) becauſe I would ſtrengthen my ſelf with their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. Beſides, young and witty men value themſelves much by being not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by ancient forms of buſineſs; for uſually they find ſome way more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, and ſeemingly more reaſonable, which uſually upon tryal is found other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for they argue their own change, or what they make it is a ſtate of melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but they foreſee not the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, which attend upon their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43868:53"/> whilſt Thucydides obſerves, the Nations, which were leſs prone to change their cuſtoms, were moſt commonly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wiſeſt. Beſides, men of this age and temper, as they are moſt enclined to be vain glorious, ſo leſs capable of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, whilſt age and experience render men apter to give wholſom than complying counſel; and as not to be too ſtrictly tied unto old forms and cuſtoms, ſo not to part with them but upon great exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. All which is the evidence of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious mind.</p>
               <p>Nothing therefore characters a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor better, than that it may be truly ſaid of him, He is a ſincere man, or, as we ſay of a good Common-wealths man, he is one that prefers the Publicks concern before his own private intereſt; ſo a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor will in affairs, that are important, rather conſider his Maſters ſervice than his Maſters inclination. And that I may ſet down all the extremities of integrity at once, (but I am afraid I am deſcribing <hi>rara avis in terris</hi>) a man that will loſe his place, or fortune, or favour, rather than not plainly, and without artifice, tell his Maſter betwixt them two, what is his opinion. Afterwards, tho' his Maſters judgment be like to be his Maſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, (becauſe Councellors are not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43868:53"/> that will as induſtriouſly obey his Maſters commands, as he would have done, if his Maſters commands had been grounded upon his own counſel; for he ought to think, that his Maſters opinion or inclination may be better than his own. When the Prince cannot admit this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor the Councellor (in caſe there be nothing immoral in it) make this ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither of them is fit for the other. If the Princes own counſels caſt what is ſettled into danger, or make it to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by extremities (tho' not illegalities) upon his own Subjects, a good man would rather make his retreat, and dye obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than ſee his Maſter or his Country run a great riſque; for it was Calliſthenes great honour, not that he is ſaid never to have betrayed his Prince unto others, but becauſe he would never condeſcend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him to himſelf, as moſt Flatterers do, or concur with him when his opinion dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Thus it's one thing to obey a Prince, another to counſel him.</p>
               <p>This imaginary ſincerity (for we may rather deſcribe it than hope to meet with it) in a Princes Councellor will incline him, that thus values ſimplicity of mind, to avoid all ſubtil and underhand ways; for a man of this temper is a judging or thinking perſon, and he knows humane
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43868:54"/> actions are beſt managed by familiar and eaſie means; for the plain hearted man, who reſolves ſingly to have his eye upon the nature of the buſineſs he is to act in, (and he cannot underſtand well the nature of an affair, if he totally forgot the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of the times and perſons engaged about it) he will diſcard ſubtilty, and not ſuper-refine upon that, which may end well, if he make not new adventures, that it might conclude better; ſince, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Mazarine obſerved, the <hi>faiſons mieux</hi> ſpoiled more buſineſs than ever it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; for ſubtilty commonly fews thorns, and often is forc'd to walk over them. Machiavels Borgia thus prick'd his own feet, and ſo did Pope Clement VII. And d'Avila obſerves, Henry the 3d grew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the intrigues his Secretary Villeroy had intangled him in; and Bentivoglio ſhews Cardinal Granvils dexterities proved Philip the Seconds intanglements. A Prince or Councellor therefore muſt not conſider the advantages the end he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will get him, and forget, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the times, and the humours of Subjects may be indomitable, or ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ſo much hazard, that it will be no wiſdom to put a Princes fortune upon the chance of a die. A Princes greatneſs ſhould riſe like a vegetable, indiſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43868:54"/> for haſting to be rich, and haſting to be great or abſolute, are both alike dangerous.</p>
               <p>No man will be long thus ſincere or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, who hath not courage; for it is an act of bravery to ſeek his Maſters advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage before his own; for courage frees him from the ſollicitude of diving into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters inclinations, or ſcrutining <hi>abditos ſenſus Principis,</hi> or being concerned what party ſtands in oppoſition unto him, or what harm they can do him; which thoughts take up the whole time of a timerous Councellor, who proſtitutes both his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and his own honour for a little ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This temper is ever reclaiming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions by careſſes, or expedients, and they, who are of it, ſpend moſt of their advice in ſhoring up the houſe they plainly ſee will fall, but hope it will laſt their time. Their trade is how to obſerve, which party in a Court prevail, and to be officious towards it, and they care not in what languiſhing condition their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters affairs are, ſo their own poſt be ſafe. With the Amſterdam dog, they will at beſt defend their ſhoulder of mutton for a time, but when they ſee the other dogs have pulled it out of the basket, they will go in for their ſhare. It was faintneſs in councel, that loſt both Rome and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43868:55"/> and I may ſay England or the Monarchy in King Charles the firſt's time; his armies diſcipline render'd them not formidable unto the Rebels, and yet the Councellors were afraid of their too great proſperity.</p>
               <p>A good Councellor ſhould be ſteady in his advice, but ſteadineſs differs much from inflexibility. He that adheres to princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is reckoned ſteady; yet when the conjuncture of affairs requires it, he muſt ſtrike ſail, and he can own it; for ſays Cicero, as affairs ſubmit themſelves often to me, ſo muſt I ſometimes unto them; <hi>Ut mihi res, ſic me rebus ſubmittere cogor.</hi> And Cato, had he been leſs poſitive, had preſerved Rome's or the Senates freedom longer. <hi>Cato optime ſentit, ſed ſaepe Reipubl. nocebat.</hi> Probity may be impetuous, and ſo conſequently nocent. Flexibility may ſuit with judgment, becauſe forc'd by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but inſtability can no way be juſtified, becauſe it is a natural inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of mind, or weakneſs of reaſoning.</p>
               <p>A wiſe Councellor will not engroſs too many affairs into his own hands, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon other mens offices; nor be apt to undervalue them in it; or be apt to raiſe his own credit by the loſs of other mens; for he that doth good offices unto others, is in the beſt way to make hearty
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43868:55"/> friends for himſelf. And he muſt be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to hear other mens advices; nay, with ſome reſpectfulneſs bear their follies; and he muſt be unconcerned, even when his own councels are not complied with, or are laid aſide. Above all, a Privy Councellor ſhould be ſecret, for without ſecreſie neither arms nor councel are like to be ſucceſsful. Auguſtus valued Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coenas for his ſecreſie; Agrippa for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious patience; and Virgil for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable and learned converſation. If there be a chink in a Council-Chamber, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, or gives as much light, as a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow doth in another room. Our great Chancellor Bacon recommends it unto Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to beware that they themſelves unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret not their own affairs; for crafty men will lay trains by diſcourſes of one kind, to find the ſecret reſolutions of another kind; ſo it is dangerous for Princes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally to treat with foreign Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</p>
               <p>But leſt this ſhould ſeem a Platonick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, or rather a ſpeculation,<note place="margin">How much it is in the power of a Prince to make good Counc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43868:56"/> of good natural endowments, and of a moral honeſty, (which will ſoon turn into piety) and if he encourage induſtry, and let young men perceive, that they muſt walk up unto preferment by ſtairs and degrees, and begin with the lower offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before they can hopefully pretend unto the higheſt; if he find not good men to ſerve him, he will make men fit to ſerve him. So as it is much the Princes own fault, when he thinks a Favourite of pleaſure or ſports, converſation and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, muſt preſently be fit to be made a guide in buſineſs; (for he can give the place, but he hath not omnipotency to give the abilities) or when he will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no man himſelf, but through the glaſs, or as the image of a man is reflected unto him from a Favourite, or ſome great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; for this is to ſtrengthen their root, and to weaken his own. For here, tho' the gift is his, the obligation is anothers; this makes him have many attendants but few ſervants; for ſervants placed about him by great men, are rather their ſpies than his ſervants. Such an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs as this, who is about him, makes him appear like a town block'd up, he can freely receive no proviſions he ſtands in need of; and his own ſervants are diſheartened, by perceiving great mens
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43868:56"/> friends and ſervants every day preferred or gratified before them. This courſe chills all publick ſpiritedneſs, for men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by Favourites think, they ſhall laſt no longer than their Patrons, who are often changed or in the wain; and ſo they come unto a Court like harveſt men, who ſerve only in a ſhort time to reap that which others ploughed, ſowed, and harrowed for; or they work only in fair weather, and when the corn is carrying into the barn. If a Prince therefore have ill ſervants, he owes much of it unto his own negligence, or not valuing that which he ſtands moſt in need of.</p>
               <p>And thus from his great Councellors and Miniſters of State,<note place="margin">A Princes menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or ſmall fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> we will come to reflect upon his menial Servants, and ſay a little of his little Family or Court, and then of his great Family or Common-Weal, or the ſeveral orders of men in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Weal, each of them being to be a part of his Regal ſtudy, for by them he may be ſerved, or he may be endangered; and neither Servant nor Subject will be long uſeful, when he obſerves there is no obſervation of what he doth. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may ſhew a Prince more his declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than when both theſe ſorts of men are unconcerned, whether he be pleaſed or diſpleaſed with their ſervice. And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43868:57"/> very often the irreverence, that is paid him in his own Court, is the mother of the neglect of his commands out of it, or that the diſcontents of the one breed the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of the other; yet it is a great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that a Government is off its hinges, when a few forward and daring men open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe his affairs, and many cautious ill willers are pleaſed at it, and ſcarce any ready to aſſert his rights; or rather, as Tacitus expreſſes it in his terms, <hi>Is habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus animorum fuit, ut peſſimum facinus aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pauci, plures vellent, omnes paterentur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Libels and licentious diſcourſes are ill Symptoms, and falſe news eaſily ſpread; and when men in place ſpeak fearfully, and thoſe that invade the Government boldly, it is a ſign reverence is loſt. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus expreſſes it, when they ſpeak, <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius quam ut Imperantium meminiſſent;</hi> or, <hi>quando mallent mandata Imperantium interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari quam exequi.</hi> Diſcontents among the Vulgars, and broken eſtates among the great ones, or if there be other combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, no man knows how ſmall a ſpark, or from whence it may come, that will ſet all on fire. When fear is greater than feeling, jealouſies will admit of no reaſoning. And when there is a general diſſolution of manners, there is ſeldom found authority enough to reclaim that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43868:57"/> people; but ſome notable change follows; for there is in a State in ſome conjuncture of time as diſcernible a publick madneſs, as there is in private men; and perchance I have lived to ſee it abroad, or at home, I think more than once.</p>
               <p>A Princes Court is a little Republick, and it is a great ſign, that the Prince is in the affection of his people, when his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are reſpected through his whole Kingdom for the reverence they bear him. Which if it be paid by ſome few great men of the place, where they come, it is ſoon imitated by all the reſt of the Country; therefore his Servants uſually called Courtiers, muſt be as courteous and civil in their ſphere, as they are willing to be kindly treated, when they are in other mens. So as a Princes family ought to be of perſons well choſen, and of good reputation and behaviour; and the nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in relation or ſervice the perſon is unto the King, the more humanity and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he ſhould ſhew to thoſe who come to Court; eſpecially thoſe who come rather to pay a duty, than make a ſuit; for this laſt ſort are to be anſwered friendly, but ſtill according unto the nature of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Acceſs ought to be eaſie, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers made with gentleneſs as well as reaſonableneſs; for the hand of haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43868:58"/> is not to reach even a courteſie; for where the receiver is diſcontented in the manner of it, the favour conferred is never half acknowledged.</p>
               <p>A Prince ſhould not admit about his Perſon men of bold tempers, and who dare openly avow immoral tenents or principles, for theſe men will ſoon call that which is good indifferent, and then they will not be long before they will call that which is vicious reaſonable; and artificially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating into his favour by keeping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with his paſſions, they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to lead him from vanity unto vice; and the fouler the latter is, if they be but an inſtrument or companion in it, the ſecurer they are in his grace; for there is at a Court no ſo ready way unto gain and preferment, as that which is got by ſome ſhameful ſervice; and ſuch men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing privy unto a Princes clandeſtine vices, they will never be quiet until they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto his publick concerns. <hi>Scire volunt ſecreta domus inde<expan>

There is nothing (ſay they) ſo ſafe for a Prince, as to make new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his own. A Prince muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and adhere even unto his errors, rather than be lightly carried over unto
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43868:58"/> other mens Judgments, leſt he ſeem to live upon a borrowed reaſon. Hence it is, or from ſuch ſmall Favorites as theſe it is, that ſome Hiſtorians have obſerved, that when the ſpring-heads of ſome Princes councils have been diſcovered, they are ſmall even to contempt. Darius's expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into Greece, aroſe either from a Phyſician unto himſelf, who told him, what excellent figs grew there, or from his Wives maid, who told her, if the King made a war upon that land, ſhe would have the great Ladies of Greece her ſlaves. Varro hath the like obſervation, and Monſieur de Pleſſis aſſigns much of the miſeries that befell the French Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Catholick League, unto the Duke of Guiſes cheating Monſieur d'Eſpernon of a Miſs. And thus often a Favorites paſſion begins a war, as well as a Princes publick intereſt. On the ſmaller ſort of ſmaller Favorites Boccalini puts a high contempt, when he ſays, all the money in a Princes treaſure will not buy ſugar enough to candy or ſweeten them. The Abbot D'Eſcallie, I remember, long ſince at Bruſſels told me a very pleaſant ſtory, how his wiſe Maſter, the Duke of Savoy, (Le viel Renard des montaignes) took from him an elegant Barber that he had, who grew ſo great a Favorite, that he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43868:59"/> truſted him in ſome of his moſt important Services; in which miſcarrying, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained unto the Abbot; <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſays the Abbot) <hi>concern not me herein, for I put him unto the outſide of your head, you put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inſide.</hi> A Prince therefore muſt be very careful in the choice of his Servants, that they be men equal unto their buſineſs, and not above it, or under it, and honeſt minded as well as ſtrong brained; for to ſerve faithfully is as neceſſary as to ſerve ably; ſince abilities ſeldom make recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for frauds, and ſince honeſt men in favour will ſeldom want the parts of able men, not yet admitted thereunto. Balzac ſays truly, <hi>the greatneſs of a Prince muſt not rob him of the pleaſanteſt part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man paſſion,</hi> i. e. the free and kind conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſome perſon,<note place="margin">A Favorite of pleaſure allowable, but not to be made a Favorite of buſineſs.</note> whom by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and unaccountable motion he likes in converſarion; for neither moral virtue nor policy puts any ſuch reſtraint upon nature; theſe correct the imperfections of ſenſual appetites, but gratifie both great and ſmall inclinations in natural and not immoral contentments. But publick Miniſters, or ſuch as privately are employed about pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs, are to be choſen by reaſon, not affection. Such choices, as hath been already obſerved, Auguſtus made, when he drew into his affection and ſervice Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43868:59"/> Horace, and Virgil, who were qualified as well to be Councellors as Companions. Beſides, an ill Favorite is often a neceſſary inſtrument or skreen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a worſe Prince; for Tacitus obſerves, Tiberius was worſe without Sejanus than with him. <hi>Tiberius</hi> (ſays he) <hi>vixit obtectis libidinibus, dum Sejanum dilexit &amp; timuit, ſed in ſcelera ſimul &amp; dedecora prorupit, poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam remoto pudore &amp; metu, ſuo tantum inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio utebatur.</hi> And people reake their ill will rather upon theſe than on their Prince.</p>
               <p>Nothing is meant more here, than that a Favorite of pleaſure ſhould not be made a Favorite of buſineſs. A Prince ſhould be the Maſter of the ſpring-head himſelf, that he may water whom he pleaſes; for if he ſuffer himſelf to be ingroſſed, and paſſes his influences by another unto all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, he may have outward reverence but never inward eſteem; for ſuch uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Favorites for the moſt part, as they are very expenſive in themſelves, ſo they are very inſolent unto others, and therefore upright and able men will not ſerve under them, Thus they are like Beacons or Lighthouſes at ſea, which old Sailers know are to be avoided; but young make towards them in the night, and endanger a ſhipwrack.</p>

               <p>The Clergy are an order of men ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part among all Nations for the divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the God of the land;<note place="margin">Clergy.</note> for the Gentile and Barbarians never wanted their Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans or their Druides, and every where they were men of prime rank; for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reverence, that was due to their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gave ſuch an authority to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that moſt commonly they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the moſt important affairs of the Nation; (for here we mention them only in relation to the Civil ſociety) none being fitter to interpoſe betwixt Prince and People, than thoſe that interceed with God for both. And the reſpect that is paid to them, is a reverence paid to God; for upon the ſame ground Princes Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors are treated with thoſe obſervances they meet with; upon the ſame are God's Miniſters. In this order of men God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in a manner viſible unto us; for when we find he hath Servants peculiar to himſelf, a Court, or Temple, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues appropriate for maintenance of both, we ſtraight conclude, <hi>of a ſurety God is in this place,</hi> or he is the Lord of this people. So as there is no greater evidence, that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety decays in a Nation, than that they are apt to conteſt or diſreſpect their Prieſts or Miniſters.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:43868:62"/>
               <p>Now as this is a valuation due to the Miniſter of God's word, ſo he himſelf is to pay a reſpect unto his own calling, and to appear worthy of it, and fitted for it; for duties are reciprocal, and he is God's husbandman, and therefore muſt cultivate his People; and if he truly diſcharge his office, in fitting them for another world, he fits them beſt for ſociety in this world, and for ſubjection to the Prince: and there is no ſuch way for him to procure the dignity, that is due to himſelf, as to exerciſe the proper virtues of his calling. Other tyes or compliances with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and manners of a People: or becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like them with them in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation begets familiarities, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Piety in themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to make their flock pious, or of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly lives, diſcretion in being friendly and helpful, or ready to adviſe and do good offices, a private information or admonition at home, or a converſation, which recommends that unto particular men out of the pulpit, which is preached unto them in it; this attracts their good will, whilſt being unconcerned with, or conforming their company to the irregular or negligent habit or cuſtom of others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the inward eſteem they ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for. This ought to be very ſincerely
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43868:62"/> Purſued; I will no be ſo uncharitable, as to ſay, it is artificially ſo done by ſome of the Romaniſts, and by ſome of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, (though I believe one gains much of his authority by his indulgences and eaſie abſolutions, and the other by his aſſurances, that they carry God's brand to mark the elect with:) only I wiſh our Country Clergy would be more ſtrict to follow the rules they receive, and I have often heard given them by their Biſhops in their viſitations: for when they influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence their flock towards God's ſervice, they lead them the eaſier to be ſubject chearfully to their Prince's laws and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And if this Order of men will expect (as juſtly they may) the Prince's protection for themſelves, they owe it him as a duty, to keep themſelves ſo in eſteem and friendſhip with their congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they may diſpoſe them to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for if they fall into the envy or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of their Pariſhioners, they who ſhould be an eaſe and coadjutors of their Prince, make their protection a burthen to him, or they become as an uſeleſs body. In this quarrelling and examining age the Governors of the Church ſhould endeavour to make matters of faith treated on with plainneſs, and not mingled with too many diſtinctions: that matters of good life be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43868:63"/> taught as much by the example of the teachers, as his expoſitions or precepts: that their Viſitations and Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction be not only formal, or in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction or gain, or rather for ſhewing their Orders, and paying for it, (as I have heard no mean men among themſelves ſay) than for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in good order; eſpecially that their excommunications be upon weighty matters, and ſomewhat that is purely Chriſtian. For though contumacy to a Court be a great fault, and that this Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Court have no other penal or legal cenſure: yet when the ſubject matter, on which the excommunication is grounded, is ſome civil or mixt concern, then this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpiritual puniſhment ſeems ſo remote, that it makes excommunication ſeem light, and draws neglect rather than reſpect or obedience to the Juriſdiction. Theſe good Fathers ſhould be known to be forward to divert a Prince from laying great or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary burthens on their Subjects; which if it be perceived by the Subject, then this temper in the Clergy will get ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the Layety, as will lead them reſpectfully to hearken to ſuch doctrines, as invite them patiently to bear grievances or preſſures; ſince it is an eminent virtue in a Chriſtian Subject to bear with the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43868:63"/> errors of a remiſs Government. Thus a Clergy muſt make themſelves as uſeful as they can in ſecular affairs both to Prince and People, if they would gain upon them in their ſpiritual concerns; and this we may ſay, is an incumbent duty upon them, as they are members of a Politick body. And in this ſenſe it is, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more concerns a Prince, in reſpect of the influence this order of men have on his Subjects, than that he provide, (as God hath done for him) that his Clergy depend on no body but himſelf; for if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Prince's Eccleſiaſtical affairs, they pretend a Superior authority to his, as making themſelves depend on a Pope, and thereby exempting themſelves from the Prince's juriſdiction, or that they can wreſt themſelves into his ſecular affairs, as they have ſome relation to Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical concerns (which even Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery hath ſet up a claim unto) then this Prince's State, and his Subjects obedience will be very precarious and dangerous: and his condition not much bettered, if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Brutus and Buchanan, or the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Jeſuits be the Interpreters of St. Paul's thirteenth Chapter to the Romans, or of St. Peter's 1. Ep. 2. ch. v. 13. And the like he may expect from an Enthuſiaſtical Teacher, who will be but <hi>binding him in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43868:64"/> chains, and his Nobles in links of iron.</hi> He muſt not be ignorant therefore, that his office ſuperviſes theirs, and when he hath not encroached upon that ſpiritual part of their office, to which they are properly ſaid to be ſet apart and conſecrated, (as adminiſtring the publick Offices of the Church, of praying for, and preaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and adminiſtring the Sacraments) then to overſee theſe Overſeers in the good or male-adminiſtration of their Offices is his duty and his ſecurity. And in this kind, how far an Epiſcopal Clergy (as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and ſetled here in England) exceeds all others through the whole world, as beſt agreeing with Chriſt's inſtitution, and the Apoſtles practice, judicious, learned, and Chriſtian Examiners will beſt and ſooneſt find out. And we will conclude our remarks upon this Order of men with this experiment, that in the year 1640, nothing raiſed ſo much the Rabble, as did the Non-conformiſt Clergy, who from all parts of the Kingdom came moſt up to the City, and filled moſt of the pulpits, and the Lecturers reſiding there; and in this preſent year 1678, nothing ſo much ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the peace of that place (nay, we may ſay of the whole Nation, for Whitehall had one kind of Guards, and the Citizens, true it is, by the King's leave, were their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43868:64"/> own Guards) as did the Orthodoxy of the Clergy, and the ſatisfactions the better ſort of Citizens took in their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who ſo prudently preached down the then ſuſpected deſigns againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſtabliſhed and ſecured loyalty by Chriſtian principles.</p>
               <p>Nobility is (or of old was) uſually the off-ſpring of virtue, or valor, or induſtry,<note place="margin">Nobility.</note> now it is more commonly the creature of the Prince; for he is the fountain of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Their order is like the leſſer or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary lights in the firmament, which attend upon the ſun; they are to ſet forth the ſplendor or majeſty of the ſoveraign throne, yet ſometimes they eclipſe it. If they withdraw their banks, they often let in an inundation of Populacy, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the throne; if they interpoſe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they ſometimes skreen the Populacy from the ſcorching heat of Soveraignty; but they prey often upon both; for as they are ſometimes a reſtraint upon the Tyrant-Prince, ſo they are often an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the giddy multitude, to be contumacious and refractory: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have been ſo unnatural, as to draw over the fickle multitude, and to joyn themſelves unto a forreign Prince, againſt their true Soveraign, as in the time of King John. Which evidences, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43868:65"/> the body Politick like the Natural, when the humors and gall overflow, and the parts loſe their temperament, the whole looſes its health. If the Nobility be few and great, they too often turn the ſcale of Government, which they ſhould keep upright; if they be many or neceſſitous, they firſt peel the Court, and then are Court inſtruments to peel the people. Nobility is a plant, that will degenerate; and though they often owe their fortunes as well as their qualities unto the Crown; yet we have too many examples among us, that the Sons and poſterity of thoſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which were wholly raiſed by the Prince, employed themſelves moſt to pull down the cloth of State. Thus the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt of men, if they may but gratifie ſome violent paſſion, or compaſs ſome preſent advantage, they deſert their ſtation, and the meaneſt things will be done by the greateſt men. When their numbers are many, they appear but like a more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Gentry. Henry the ſeventh did as it were undermine their greatneſs, which in ſo mixt a Monarchy as ours is, was not very compatible with Soveraignty in ſo few hands. From that time this order of men in our Government hath not only been in the wain, but may be ſuppoſed much to have degenerated; for the ancient
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43868:65"/> Nobility have much leſſened their Eſtates and have made way for the principles of Oceana; for cutting off the dependencies from themſelves, they made the Yeoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry free, which bred our multitude of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, who (ſays Mr. Harrington) have now the ballance of our land or land-rents, and conſequently, in his opinion, of our wealth, and by his arguments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of our power: but conſult Mr. <hi>Wrenn,</hi> and Oceana is drowned. And our Reformation did as much for our Church-lands, which ſeemed a fifth or ſixt of the Kingdom. All which contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the late temporary ſubverſion of our Government in our late good, but unfortunate Prince's reign, Charles the firſt. God did reſtore us from this capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, but whether he be not drawing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, for the abuſe of that mercy, the judgment we generally deſerved as Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, he knows, whoſe ways are in the depth, and paſt finding out. This change had never been effected, had not the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility forſaken that cloth of State, they owed their dignity unto, and ought to have protected: but infirm muſt that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace be, whoſe main beams ſhrink from the walls; but down will thoſe beams fall, which are withdrawn from what ought to ſupport them. And when our Gentry do
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43868:66"/> the like, our very Soveraignty will fall to be among Mechanicks; and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the vulgar Rabble will have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for their ambition, and when paltry Players (both Clerical and Lay) have got the habits of King, and Prieſt, and Nobles, and Gentry, the mock Comedy for ſome time will paſs for a good form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he that rules in heaven can only predict, whilſt an honeſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling, not upbraiding, ſpirit may inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively, becauſe rationally, forewarn.</p>
               <p>Nobility in all nations, as they have had more honor deferred unto them than other ranks of men, ſo they have had more priviledges and immunities. Boccalini, I am ſure, hath the reflexion: but I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not whether I follow him ſtep by ſtep; he reſembles (as I think) Princes unto ſhepherds, the Commonalty unto the ſheep, and the Nobility (for Nobility were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally Soldiery) unto the doggs. (This is not a derogatory term, for it is but to follow a Metaphor.) <hi>So as,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if theſe be overawed, that they may not bark and fight for their charge</hi> (for they are to defend the ſhepherd as well as the ſheep) or, if they be not armed with an iron collar of Generoſity, (ſome extraordinary prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence or priviledge) but be awed and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſhepherds boys, or the rams of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43868:66"/> the flock, both ſhepherd and ſheep in a time of need, or when ſome wolfiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering King ſhall invade, or a Home. U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper undermine both; I ſay then, ſuch a ſort of generous daring Spirits will be wanting, and a bold Fellow, that hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a loaden horſe on foot, will think, he is as fit to ride on horſeback, (and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he may be ſo) as the greateſt Lord: for a crab-wine is preferred to ſupport the ſtomach before vinegar, that ſprang from a generous grape, becauſe turned. If No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility degenerate, Princes ſhould employ men, who have the virtues, not the titles of great men. But if Nobles have both, they are the ſitteſt men to be employed for their extraction; and their already being maſters of moderate fortunes makes them have great advantages over men of natural and acquired parts, though never ſo well exerciſed or experimented, if new men; for the tree is leſs envied, that grows from a root, and hath been long in growing, than the muſhroom, that was not at night, and ſhews a head in the morning. Henry the ſeventh ſuppoſed he had ſtrengthened the Crown, when he cut the wings of the Nobility; Henry the eighth vindicated the juſt rights of the Crown, from the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations of a foreign uſurping Biſhop; both which acts made great changes in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43868:67"/> the ſtate of our Government. Queen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſabeth both unto Biſhop and Nobleman allowed a due honor: but in her time, a novel Schiſmatical Presbyterian humor crept into the veins of ſome of all orders; ſo as too many Presbyters deſigned to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel the Biſhops with themſelves, and too many Nobles, Gentry, and Commons found fair hopes to ſet up a real Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with an inſignificant or titular Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. And thus was made an inundation in Charles the firſt's time, which ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſcepter, and the ſword, and the miter; and though the waters are fallen again into their banks, there is yet much ſlime left behind, and the ill vapor, that not long ſince gave the Common-weal a ſyncope, may turn into an apoplexy, if the three Eſtates be not apt to do right unto one another, and all unto their Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Soldiery.</note>Soldiery may be accounted a leſſer ſort of Nobility; for arms raiſed in the firſt times private men into the rank of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as uſually favor of Princes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs, or the penny doth now; but honor loſt its ſpirit, or luſtre, or eſteem among men, ſince flattery or a ſum of money became the current price for it. No man can properly be accounted a Soldier: though he may be a ſtout and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43868:67"/> valiant man, who hath not been frequent in dangers, and ſerved ſome time at the trade.</p>
               <p>Gentry are the leſſer Nobility,<note place="margin">Gentry.</note> and did uſually influence the Commons, as the Nobility did uſually them: but as they emancipated themſelves from dependance on the Lords, ſo among us the Freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have withdrawn much of their reſpect from them. For that laſt rank of men, ſince the ſale of Church-lands ſince Henry the eighth's time, and of the Crowns part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much of its deſmeaſnes, and the Nobility and Gentry both making great ſales unto men of profeſſions, of what was theirs, Lawyers, Merchants, and great Traders being now great purchaſers, we may juſtly ſay the ballance of the Kingdom in our age is much changed from what it was in former ages. And our young Nobles, both of the greater and leſſer rank, having rather a forward and a ſinical education, <hi>viz.</hi> rather haſtening timely or early to appear ſuperficially men, than ripely and throughly to be ſo, they often run out of their eſtates, before conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively they know they are in them. And by theſe often changes, which the ancient Families of moſt Counties undergo in their eſtates, the publick concerns or form of Government is leſs ſteddy than it ought to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43868:68"/> be in a well conſtituted Common-weal. And if a Prince made this a part of the care of his Government, to preſerve and countenance the ancient Families both of his Nobility and Gentry, and to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch as neither took into arms, nor civil employments: if he obliged them ſometimes with offices freely given, or diſobliged them not, by conferring digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon ſome new Upſtarts, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in their Counties, and overtop them at firſt coming, which their wives cannot bear, being to loſe their precedence, theſe ſort of men keeping their reſidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their neighbors would prove the beſt ſecurity both of a Prince's perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and their loyalty in the laſt King's time was moſt examplary: whilſt the men of profeſſion, the Lawyers, and the Merchants were as remiſs (to ſay no more) in their duty. For from men of pleaſure may be expected more loyalty, than from men of gain, who are ever apt to follow the tide, which uſually turns into profit, whilſt the other, content with their own eſtates, affect ſecuring the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſtate of things. Great Miniſters of State heretofore were not aſhamed to keep a good correſpondence with the moſt conſiderable and judicious perſons of this rank in every County; for they are not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43868:68"/> only valuable in their Country, but fill up many of thoſe places, which ſerve in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Common-weal muſt be beſt advanced, when it is ſerved by men, who are beſt affected unto the eſtabliſhed Government. And it muſt needs be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral comfort unto the Subject, when a Prince deſires to be ſerved by Perſons, that are neither mercenary nor factious. Theſe are the men, that in their Countries keep up good order and induſtry; ſo as to have a good regard unto them, may not only be reckon among a Prince's policies, but among his virtues. If they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neglected, whether the diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the great men, or the ſtorm from the multitude, they are not like ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to interpoſe: for though duty oblige all men in the politick body, as in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, when a vein is opened, to endeavor to ſtop it, by running towards it, yet the wiſe Hiſtorian hath obſerved, too many men chooſe their own ſecurity, rather than with hazard to obviate the danger of the Common-weal. <hi>Tuta &amp; preſentia, quam vetera &amp; periculoſa mallent.</hi> But this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is, when the State wants noble and generous Perſons to depend on: for when men of eminency are not on the ſtage to defend laws, men of loyalty will not be much concerned under what laws they live,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43868:69"/> and thus moſt commonly innovations are admitted.</p>

But this ſort of men having not buſied their underſtandings about ſuch diſtinctions, they are too too often the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy inſtruments to beat down truth in all kinds, and ſet up error; for they are not more fickle in their Religion, than they are unto their Government, or rather Governors, from whom they are apt to be

It is the wiſdom of a State in theſe laſt ages of the world, not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them with unrevealed niceties of Religion, or to oblige them unto many rites and ceremonies, the uſe whereof they cannot penetrate into; for this age, like the former will not take all on truſt, but to keep them in employment, and out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity by ſecuring their trades and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, the moſt probable way to make them good Sons of the Church, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the State.

               <p>Of the Divine we have ſaid much alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, therefore ſhall only ſay here, that he manages the opinions about celeſtial and moral truths, or the ſtate of men after this life. The Phyſician is to preſerve the health of the body. The Lawyer the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43868:71"/> concerns of a man's eſtate. The Soldier is to ſee juſtice may be executed. The Merchant exports the ſtaple, and imports the forreign commodities: and the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vents both by retail. The Artificer manufactures all, and the Husbandman provides food for all, for the King himſelf lives by the field.</p>
               <p>In no profeſſion can any man be truly a good Citizen, that is tranſported either with pleaſure or covetouſneſs. It is a great ſentence of Saluſt's, <hi>Nec quiſquam extollere ſe, aut divina attingere poteſt, niſi omiſſis pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniae aut corporis gaudiis;</hi> for with neither of theſe two taints or corruptions can the Divine ever be believed, that he means as he ſays. And with them the Phyſician and Lawyer will either neglect or beggar their Patients and Clients. The Soldier grows cruel and rapacious, if theſe vices ſeize on him, and will ſooner loſe or ſell the place he is to defend and maintain, than keep it. And the Merchant, Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Artificer trade unfairly, and not unto their own Countries advantage by covetouſneſs; the one bringing in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which ſerve only unto ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and vanity, or to pleaſe the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; the other either adulterating, or working ſo ſlightly his wares, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners decline the trade; ſo as all theſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43868:71"/> inconveniences, and the prevention of them, fall under the Prince's care and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, or art of Government. Indeed in the body politick, as in the natural, there not being the leaſt thing done, but requires an influence of the Governors. He muſt inſpirit every profeſſion, or they ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>None of theſe profeſſions are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for there muſt be a Divine,<note place="margin">No profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</note> though every man were ſo knowing, as not to need inſtruction: ſince his Office is to be the mouth of the Congregation unto God. A Lawyer cannot be wanting, becauſe two men may mean very juſtly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and yet not know how to aſſure one another in legal terms. A Phyſician cannot be wanting, becauſe health will impair, and ſickneſs ought to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a man, that is in a ſtate of health: upon which reaſon a man ſafely cannot be his own Phyſician; for ſickneſs often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives a man of ſenſe, and diſables him to judge his own caſe. One man's neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries muſt be ſupplied from various trades, and that makes neceſſary all the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct callings. And thus the wiſdom of God, that deſigned men for ſociety, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, that men could not live with one another, if they had not likewiſe been to have lived by one another. True it is,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43868:72"/> the Soldier is but a neceſſary evil in a Common-weal; for would all men obſerve juſtice, there would need to be no force; for force is never to be uſed, but when reaſon and law are by violence withſtood. It is depraved, not ſincere, nature makes this profeſſion neceſſary; but that neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes it very honorable and uſeful; and as it requires a great courage to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, and a great preſence of mind: ſo this is hardly attained without a profeſſion accuſtomed unto danger. It likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great natural ſtrength of body, and moral virtue of the mind; for no order of Theologues, no, nor of Penitents, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go thoſe hardſhips, which the fatigues of war bring with them; nor have they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter occaſion of moral vertue, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain ferocity, and to exerciſe huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

The ſame natural re igion (or that reaſonableneſs it is grounded upon) ſhews, why men, who thus admitted a God, thought, that God deſigned for himſelf pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and ſeparate ſervants, temples, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all theſe to be of the choiceſt perſons and things, that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſons of men, becauſe they were dedicated unto the ſupreameſt eſſence. Hence it is we may conceive, that all the religion of the Heathen world was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; for it was ſo neceſſary for man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43868:74"/> upon a ſuperior nature, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as the Lord Bacon ſays) he would not have been able to have ſupported the frailty of his own nature.<note place="margin">The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens care of religion.</note> Man admitted therefore many Gods, rather than he would be without one; and what were all the opinions of fate and deſtiny, and Elyzium fields, but an acknowedgment of providence and immortality? and what were all the Philoſophers grave precepts about morality, but a groping after the Decalogue, and the diſperſed Ethicks in Scripture? How careful was this blind world of their Dianas, and Palladiums, and topical Gods; for herein they thought lay their hope and their ſtrength, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected not a victory, till they could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant or draw over to themſelves the God of the place. Plutarch could ſay, depraved nature runs into ſuperſtition or atheiſm, and then ſound reaſon led unto true religion, which is but an obedience unto God's laws written in mans heart, upon the ground of piety and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>No nation would ever allow atheiſm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, nor let the divinity of their Gods (though falſe ones) be invaded; for this among the Athenians cſtl Socrates his life, and Diagoras was baniſhed by them for but ſpeaking doubtfully of them; and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43868:74"/> Marcus Tullius, one of the two Library-keepers of the Sybills books, was ſewn into a ſack, and flung into the ſea, but for making an imbezlement or a raſure. Lucius Albinus flying from the Galls, with his wife and children, ſeeing the Veſtal Virgins on foot, deſcended from his chariot to ſave and eaſe them; and they all agreed in this, that ſacriledge was much more heinous than theft, and that though Dionyſius the Syracuſian prided himſelf in his proſperity, even by this ſin, yet the direful vengeances, which befel his ſon, were aſſigned to be judgments on the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge of the father. It is well known, how erronious the Heathen Divinity was; and yet we cannot but think, that theſe reverences to falſe Gods were acceptable to the true. It was the lapſe of nature, and the ſeduction of the evil ſpirit, and inadvertence and habit in evil, that made men thus groſly miſtake the object of their belief; but it was natural reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that made them determine, there was ſomewhat in this kind to be believed; and their immoral actions (eſpecially as they were nocent to civil ſociety) fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the correction of thoſe laws, which were framed to make ſociety beneficial.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The care of religion.</note>Now the firſt reaſon for the firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is, that religion neglected or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed weakens all other parts of government. <hi>Religio neglecta aut ſpreta trahit ſecum rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicam;</hi> for where there is but an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to it, or a want of devotion and inward eſteem of it, the ſoul of moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is loſt; for men will be rather tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for health, than for the peace of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or to have a fitneſs by piety to have an intercourſe with their God; and juſtice will be obſerved rather as an outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with laws, than an inward eſteem of ſuch a beneficial tye, in relation to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43868:75"/> For it is the love of juſtice, which flows from religion, not the fear of its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, that inſpirits government; for this values the Legiſlators authority and wiſdom, the other dreads only the Lictor's rods. Secondly, Government is never freely and chearfully obeyed, but when it is ſuppoſed God's ordinance, and that it is accounted a part of religion ſo to eſteem it; elſe obedience will be more precarious, than the nature of it will admit. The commiſſion of goverment therefore iſſues out of God's Chancery, and directs the Prince to direct his government to the benefit of the ſubject; and yet when he fails therein, leaves no appeal to the ſubject, but unto his providence, who preſcribes to both; for Nero's vices were not half ſo pernicious to the empire (no, nor to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men) as were the revolts even from that monſter, and from his Succeſſors, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, who were but peſtilential breaths of the ſame ill va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por. When conſpiracy had caſt out Kings, the Conſul's rule ſeemed ſo majeſtick and arbitrary, that the Commonalty muſt needs be tempering it by Tribunitial power; ſo as Livy obſerves, that the cord of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was ſo ſtrongly haled at each end, (or extremity) that there was no ſtrength left in the midſt; and that ſtrife
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43868:76"/> was more for the management and rule, than for the ſafety and preſervation of the State, and all theſe revolutions, becauſe government was not ſuppoſed God's ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but the peoples choice. Thus we ſee it is religion, that only makes Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and liberty ſociable, or ſets ſuch bounds to majeſty in the Prince, as may advance concord among the Citizens. Caſt off this temper, and every miſtaken judgment will produce ſuch angry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, as will neither endure the ordinary evils or ſores of government, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon remedies or ſalves for its cure. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the higheſt throne, though never ſo wiſe, powerful, or ſincere, depends upon Providence, which can either by natural or moral cauſes diſappoint all its beſt laid deſigns. An earthquake, a ſtorm, or a treachery fruſtrates all man can do, whilſt nothing can withſtand heavenly benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the very opinion men have, that the Gods are propitious to them, gives diligence and courage in all attempts.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the reaſons, and many more, why government muſt be ſupported by religion. Next we will offer a few, why the religion of every Nation ſhould be but one.<note place="margin">Religion ſhould be but one.</note> Firſt, Religion is the higheſt, as well as the ſtrongeſt obligation upon the mind of man; ſo as if that admit any
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43868:76"/> principles of liberty, or exemption from Civil authority, diſobedience ſhelters it ſelf, and replies, it is fit to ſerve God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man, and ſo grows incorrigible, becauſe reaſonably it may juſtifie it ſelf: (though that be an error as will be ſoon proved.) Secondly, Men of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious temper either infect one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or are miſled by ſome ſubtil knaves, who make good gain of men, who are of a ſuperſtitious devotion, and who make conſcience of every little thing, and are apt to believe vain and fooliſh propheſies, or interpret revelations. And thus ſays Livy in his fourth book, they became a publick offence, inſomuch as the Aediles had in charge, that no other Gods ſhould be worſhiped, but thoſe of the Romans; nor after any other manner, than had been uſual in their native Country,</p>
               <p>Indeed if it were rightly conſidered, the religion of all Nations ſhould be but one, becauſe all ſhould ſerve but one God, and he by the tradition unto the Patriarchs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, and by his divine preſcripts under the Law, and by the revelation of his will by the Meſſiah and his Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Moſaic-Law, made his will known in all neceſſary, natural, moral, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths, tending unto ſalvation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Kings and Prieſts were the guardians,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43868:77"/> but not the parents; for they were to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in matters, immediately relating to ſalvation, nothing but what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, though in matters relating to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and order in his ſervice, or in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of civil concern, they were authorized to give the law ſuitable to their own beſt judgments, and all ſubordinate to them were thus to ſeek an unity in the faith, and a common utility in the State in the band of peace. Thus God is a God of order and not of confuſion; and if he made religion a ſupport to government, private men, by framing new axioms of their own, to exempt themſelves from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedience, or to weaken the ſinews of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, muſt not diſtract it. For if a Soveraign may command one thing, which God hath not forbidden, and a high Prieſt another, which God hath not revealed, or a private perſon contradict both in thoſe things, which are both true and ſuitable to their diſtinct authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then the reins or girdle of all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, divine, eccleſiaſtical or civil, is diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Among the Gentile world inſtituted religion was no diſturber of government, becauſe it conſiſted principally in outward rites, ceremonies, and obſervances. But in the Chriſtian religion, God being a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43868:77"/> God of his honor and truth, it hath great influence on government, becauſe the main end of it,<note place="margin">Inſtituted Religion was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> as it was to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and clear the intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the divine and the intellectual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo it was to reſtore natural religion, and to cleanſe that polluted ſtream. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Church, which upon falſe gloſſes on inſtituted religion introduces corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in natural, and weakens civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, that it may uſurp Eccleſiaſtical, or diſpences with moral duties, that men may be the more obſervant of their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial laws, makes the buttreſs, which was to ſupport the wall, thruſt it down. And thoſe Princes, whom God bridled by his moral law, in the exerciſe of their Soveraignty, weaken but their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, when they decline thoſe laws, natural religion and common juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended unto them, as to be the baſis of all their civil, municipal, and human laws. Nor doth any ſpirit more weaken go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by pretence of religion, than thoſe Enthuſiaſtical perſons, who upon pretence of particular impulſes, reſpect neither hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nor divine laws;<note place="margin">The ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences on Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick principles.</note> for theſe can fall in love with their own ſelves and their tribe, and broach doctrines, that we may ſay turn the world topſie turvy; for one ſays, 1. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is founded in grace, and thereby
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43868:78"/> is all Soveraignty overthrown; though the ſame men at the ſame time read, that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus was Gods Anointed as well as David. Another ſort of them ſay, 2. None have right unto the creature, but the godly; though God makes his ſun to ſhine, and his rain to fall on the bad as well as the good: and they will judge likewiſe, who are thoſe; and then what becomes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of their fellow ſubjects, whom they account uſurpers thereof. 3. An impulſe of a brain-ſick or vindicative ſpirit muſt be by a third ſort a command from God, and who then is ſecure of life? Neither doth there want thoſe, who would be as holy in other mens opinions, as they are are in their own: and therefore their words muſt be accepted as an oath, and ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment lamed in a principal ſinew, and the reverence and awe, which mankind hath ever expreſt of God's name to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract truth, muſt be laid aſide, that their ſanctity might be juſtified. But ſuch men as theſe by their ſuperſtitions may contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ſenſe, philoſophy, natural and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted religion, and fall ſo low in their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry demeanors, (as are our Quakers and Seekers outward carriage) that that which is ridiculous and irrational muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted religious, or the government muſt be overthrown. 4. Nay, a ſoberer
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43868:78"/> ſort of men will ſo venerate their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations and dogma's, that if Civil or Eccleſiaſtical authority reſtrained the divulging their opinions, though contrary to that of their national Church, their petty and ſmall truths, if truths, muſt be juſtifications to them to diſquiet the peace of the government. Upon this whole repreſentation, (beſides condole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which might lead all theſe ſorts of men unto ſome modeſty, what have we to ſay, but that all this is contradictory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Goſpel-ſpirit, moſt of theſe men pretend unto? for if Chriſt in his own perſon, and his Apoſtles in theirs, would not reſiſt ſecular Governors, (for that great truth, on which all other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical truths depend, i. e. that God was reconciled unto the world by his Son Jeſus Chriſt) but chearfully ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto authority, and undergo the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhent that was laid on them: then if Pope, Presbyter, or Phanatick would now think themſelves bound to the ſame ſubmiſſion, it might be well thought, it would prove the beſt cure for the two firſt's uſurpations, and the laſt's deluſion. But in order to a remedy, if we will hear a wiſe man's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there is no better way to ſtop the riſing of new Sects, than to reform (I have forgot his words) groſs and known
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43868:79"/> abuſes, or troubleſome niceties, and to compound ſmaller differences, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed mildly, rather by gentleneſs than vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and to convert or win over the principal Authors by ſome countenance or preferment, than to imbitter them by ſcorns. But all this is to be meant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards modeſt Diſſenters, and ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile neither governments; for if God lead his people by the hand of Moſes and Aaron, and have ty'd men to them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or religious obſervances of them, and any ſort of men in matters that are not immoral, may riſe up againſt them, and ſay, <hi>ye take too much upon you, ye ſons of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> or <hi>what have we to do with Moſes?</hi> all government is at at end. And when the religion eſtabliſhed in a land is rent by diſcords, and the holineſs of the Profeſſors of that religion is much abated and grown hypocritical, and ſo to honeſt minds ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous (as it was about Mahomet's time, for then the Neſtorian and Arian hereſies much abounded both in Aſia and Africa) then ſays this great Chancellor, <hi>you may look, not only for a new Sect, but poſſibly for a new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> And no diſobediences to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are ſo dangerous, as thoſe that are grounded upon religion, nor no Sect ſo likely to prevail, as thoſe, who complain of the preſent management of affairs, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43868:79"/> promiſe great liberties and exemptions.</p>
               <p>I am far from believing,<note place="margin">The mind cannot be forced, yet it may be reſtrained.</note> there is any power in a Prince or a Church to force a man to believe; for no man can force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but in civil or ceremonial concerns: if a Prince or a Prieſt require that, which another thinks not prudent, or is of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature in it ſelf, Subjects are bound to nothing, or they are bound in matter of this nature to ſubmiſſion; for ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance can never truly wound conſcience. A Prince may make a civil law about Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, which an experienc'd Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may know will not work its end; and yet he is bound to an obedience; and the Church may enjoyn an imprudent rite, and Chriſtian liberty may cenſure it ſo; and nevertheleſs it requires an outward conformity. And thus we ſee, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conduces to civil quiet, by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a liberty in judging the injunctions of authority, and yet making innocent the obedience thereunto. For if God, in things relating to his own honor, exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the ſubject from the civil authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſubmitted him to a paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then it is reaſonable to judge, he doth it much more in all things, which concern only mens ſociable and civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. And this is enough to prove, how ſtrong a pillar religion is unto the houſe of government.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:43868:80"/>
               <p>It is a great obſervation of Valerius Maximus's, whatever the Augurs declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Gods, the Senate determined not againſt, <hi>Religionique ſummum imperium ceſſit; omnia namque poſt religionem noſtra ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas duxit, etiam in quibus ſummae majeſtatis conſpici decus voluit.</hi> And they took care religion ſhould be truly taught amongſt them: inſomuch that they gave to the forreign cities under their government Sons of their Prophets to inſtruct them; ſays this good Author, <hi>Decem filii ſingulis Etruriae populis percipiendae ſacrorum diſciplinae gratia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Scipio Africanus is ſaid never to have gone about any buſineſs, but firſt he went to the temple.</p>
               <p>Governments or bodies politick are as ſubject to diſeaſes, as bodies natural are; for a State may be free from violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive fits, and yet may fall into a paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or hectick diſtemper, or an atrophy; for it is an ill ſign in a State, when ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects dare not rebel, and yet grow ſullen; for ſuch mutinies make no noiſe, and yet looſen all the joynts and ligaments of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. Beſides theſe hardly to be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſickneſſes of State, there are periods of times and revolution of things, which have ripened a State for a death, even when it ſeems in a good condition of health, or
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43868:80"/> whilſt it hath marrow in its bones, or a good condition of plenty and peace; for ſo was the time of our late change begun in 1640, when we ſaw in few years after, that there was but one ſtep betwixt the higheſt and the loweſt condition. So as unleſs <hi>Providence keep the City, the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waketh but in vain;</hi> and nothing keeps Subjects out of the way of rebellion, nor Princes in the way of juſtice, as doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Juſtice the next pillar of Government;<note place="margin">Juſtice.</note> religion and juſtice both ſpring immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God; for it was the eternal wiſdom that formed the ligament or bond, which we call religion, which ſhould tye, as by a law, every rational creature to perform the juſtice of his nature, which other creatures obſerve by inſtinction, man by choice. So as a law is but a rule what things the creature ſhould follow, and what fly. Thus the eternal Wiſdom wrote natural laws in the very eſſence or rationality of man, and by this rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity this creature was capacitated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him poſitive laws. When man offends againſt the natural law, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience checks him, and when he offends againſt the poſitive, ſome known revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or unqueſtioned tradition, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God, muſt be his accuſer.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43868:81"/> Hence laws uſually are divided into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which are thoſe, which flow from the law of nature, or ceremonial, which are thoſe, which flow from ſome poſitive law of God, or judicial, which ſhould imitate the juſtice of Natural laws, and were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſome men, as unto the Jews, by God himſelf, or from the law of Nature, and the rationality of man, unto all others, and are framed by men in order to the exerciſe of juſtice among themſelves, and are made as conformable, as may be, unto the law natural and eternal, and have for their end the common good of that ſociety, which is under the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Head or Soveraign of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. So as every ſuch law ought to be honeſt, and poſſible to be kept; every ſuch law containing in it two powers, <hi>viz.</hi> directive in what it preſcribes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active in puniſhing offenders againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Juſtice, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and civil.</note>Now juſtice is but a performance of ſome act, which ſome law requires. And as we ſaid on the former head, religion was either natural or inſtituted; ſo we muſt ſay on this, it is either natural or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Indeed, natural juſtice is an eſſential part of natural religion, and ſo is inbred in man;<note place="margin">Why natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral juſtice ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds civil.</note> and that is the reaſon natural juſtice ſo far exceeds civil, or what human laws preſcribes. For human laws cannot
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43868:81"/> extend their ſanction, or rewards and puniſhments unto deſires and concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcences, out of which all civil injuſtices ariſe; and ſome offences or injuſtices ſeem unto Legiſlators ſo trivial, that there is no law or ſanction againſt them. Yet natural juſtice prohibits even ſuch offences, which made the great Naturaliſt and Statesman Cicero ſay, It was a narrow, or a mean thing, to be juſt only as far as civil law required; <hi>quam anguſta eſt innocentia ad legem bonum eſſe;</hi> or <hi>quanto latius officiorum patet, quam juris regula;</hi> for humanity and liberality <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are left out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tables of the Romans. Indeed both Tables of the Decalogue are but parts of natural juſtice: ſo as a man may be a good Citizen, <hi>Vir bonus eſt is, qui conſulta Patrum,</hi> &amp;c. when he is not a good man, or when he narrows that juſtice, which he owes to men, unto civil ſanctions.</p>
               <p>Juſtice is concerned in
<list>
                     <item>making,</item>
                     <item>executing,</item>
                     <item>obeying,</item>
                  </list> laws.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. In making them;<note place="margin">Juſtice in making.</note> for the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt ſincerely be convinced, the law is beneficial for the Government and for the Governed; for if it ſerve only perſonal ends, as that the Prince and Governors by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43868:82"/> it ſingly reap the advantage, and that it conduce not to common good, it wants the beſt character of a law. The like it doth, if an unruly multitude force a law from him, in prejudice of the good conſtitution and ſtrength of the Government or Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Secondly, if laws be made unto good ends,<note place="margin">Executing.</note> and not executed, they become a ſnare; for uſually the breach of a civil law carries with it ſome profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and ſo one man to his loſs obſerves that law, which another through his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience gains by. And non-execution of laws leads men to the neglect of the Government; for they think it a fooliſh thing to be tied by that cord,<note place="margin">Obeying Laws.</note> which others ſo eaſily break. Thirdly, therefore when laws are made, ſubjects muſt make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obey them; for it is a debt they owe unto their Prince, and unto the whole ſociety, and to every particular man of it. So as a Legiſlator muſt make a law no ſnare; a Magiſtrate muſt impartially exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, and a Subject conſcientiouſly obey it.</p>
               <p>The law of nature is the rule of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and civil laws; Tully could ſay, <hi>Nos legem bonam a malà nullà aliâ ratione, niſi Natura norma dividere poſſumus.</hi> And Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, <hi>Imbecillitas eſt humani intellectus in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> cauſa legem quaerere, ubi rationem natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43868:82"/> invenires.</hi> A law therefore muſt be ſuitable to religion, agreeable to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (not humorous) diſpoſition of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and muſt tend unto publick good. And thus civil and judicial laws made by men are manifeſt proofs of moral laws written by God in man; for they ever confirm thoſe <hi>laws,</hi> and conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereunto, and are adapted to civil caſes only.</p>
               <p>Laws therefore are made both in defence of the Government and Governors,<note place="margin">Laws in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Subject.</note> as well as of the Governed in their ſeveral concerns of life, liberty, property and good name, fame or reputation; and the breach of theſe laws falls under ſeveral penalties, higher or lower,<note place="margin">Penalties.</note> as the offence is; for it is treaſon and miſpriſion of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to offend againſt the Government or Prince; and it is excommunication to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt Eccleſiaſtical authority; and it is murther and felony, or a capital pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, to take away a mans life, or rob him of his goods; and he falls under a pecuniary or corporal puniſhment, that robs a man of his liberty or good name. Thus juſtice, whether it be political or private, is the defence of the Head and Body in ſociety,<note place="margin">How laws oblige the Prince, and how the Subject.</note> and obliges the Prince by the directive part of the law, tho' not the coactive; (for therein he is ſubject only
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43868:83"/> unto God) to be juſt unto, and tender of the ſubject; and by the directive and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active part of it, obligeth the Subject u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly and impartially to honor, aid, and obey him in his government. Nay, a man by it is defended from himſelf, as well as from others; for men by exceſſes and penury are often unjuſt unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and unto their relations. And this reſtrains a man from uſing even his own to his own private detriment, as well as unto the publicks; for the publick has a right both in his perſon and private poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and all this, <hi>ne Reſpublica capiat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid detrimenti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This virtue guides men in peace, and regulates them in war, and frames all ſound council. It is that in the Politick Body, which conſent of parts makes in the Natural: for it gives amongſt the members thereof a fellow-feeling of each others ſtate. It makes the foot content to ſupport the body, and the body the head, and the head to influence by its animal ſpirits all the members. It admoniſhes the ſtomach, not wilfully to ſend up fumes and jealouſies to annoy the head, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates the head, not to caſt down rheumes and catarrhs upon the lungs, leaſt the State be ſhort breathed, and ſo ſhort liv'd; whilſt mutual juſtice and love, like
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43868:83"/> the harmony and good temper of humors, begets peace, which we may call publick health.<note place="margin">Juſtice di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtributes rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.</note> And thus it becomes the beſt ſtay of a common weal, when it diſtributes juſtly rewards and puniſhments, chaſing partiality from the diſpenſation of rewards, and paſſion or ſeverity from that of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We may ſay of it, it was implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by nature, and cultivated by natural religion, and revived by inſtituted. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, being it ſelf famous for making this a radical principle, that men ſhould do to others as they would be done unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; obliging men under any kind of government, and in any ſtate, bond or free, to obſerve their own laws, and not to violate thoſe, by which they held com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with any foreigners: Princes even to be content with their own bounds, knowing the poſſeſſion of a real virtue was much more than the poſſeſſion of an uſurped dominion; ſince no one perſon is able to influence the dominion of the whole earth, but he that made it. And even he as man refuſed it, probably becauſe he would wean the moſt aſpiring minds, and powerfulleſt Princes from affecting it. Thus making juſtice a guide to modeſty, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoveraignty to him, who made the whole, and diſtributes it by parcels to whomſoever he pleaſes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Council.</note>Council is a deliberate conſidering of a particular affair by a man's ſelf, with the help of ſome other. Every council ought to ariſe from ſome knowledge of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, or of the nature of it, and be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on experience, and managed by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with an unbyaſſed mind: ſo as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an ignorant and unexperienced and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious perſon is not fit either to give or receive council. He that is to receive it, be he Prince or private man, muſt have weighed and deliberated the matter he takes council upon within himſelf, or elſe he will not be capacitated to judge of the advice given him. So as men muſt habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate themſelves in their own affairs, that they may render themſelves capable of council;<note place="margin">What fits a Prince for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> eſpecially a Prince, whoſe edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and his own contemplation ſhould have verſt him in ſome general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, before he can be fit to receive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advices upon particular affairs. For unleſs he have conſidered or ſtudied the nature of mankind, the conſtitution of his own Government, the genius and inclination of his own people, the power and intereſt of his neighbouring Princes, and ſuch like general heads, (unto which all determinations of particular affairs ſhould be ſquared) he himſelf cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be fit to take council.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43868:84"/> Beſides, (as has been obſerved before up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of Councellors) if he have not judged of perſons, as well as things, his policies will be weakned. Nor will any thing ſo probably render counſel uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to him, as a converſation with thoſe, who being not able to give counſel, through the familiarity of their Prince, uſually deride council. Princes therefore (who need council moſt) ought to be moſt careful with whom they converſe; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation inſenſibly inſinuates it ſelf, and a Favorite's folly either becomes a council, as given by him, or makes a Prince diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a ſound council given by another; ſo as few Princes thrive by council, who are miſled by converſation. Hence we ſee, that Princes ſhould buſie their minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout determining within themſelves their own affairs, that from without themſelves they might receive advice; for men moſt carefully adviſe them, whom they know to be habited to weigh their own affairs: for if the veſſel be empty, they are leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conſider, what liquor they pour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. It is too hard a task for any man to give rules, how to give, or how to take council; ſince affairs are ſo various, and particulars depend ſo much upon their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, no better rule can be given, than not to remove a preſent evil at the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43868:85"/> price of a future laſting inconvenience; for it never fares well with thoſe Princes, who conceive,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Expedient and a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> that an <hi>Expedient</hi> fills up the place of a council; for ſuch palliate cures are but temporary ſatisfactions, and bring a State into a friable or crumbling condition for nothing, which wounds the conſtituent parts of a government, or ſhakes its foundation, or transfers power from a Prince to any other order of men, is rccompenced by any ingenious Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. <hi>Belluarum eſt</hi> (ſays Cicero) <hi>vivere in diem, noſtra concilia ad ſempiternitatem ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt.</hi> Wiſe men foreſee remote conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and weak men live from hand to mouth.

               <p>Of the qualifications of a Councellor we have largely ſpoken already. The wiſe Chancellor Bacon makes the very modes of conſultation advance much the conſult, and ſo neglects not ſet times, place, as a Council-chamber, the figure of a council-board, whereby men may conveniently hear and be heard, that the ſtate of the queſtion or propoſition debated be put up in writing; leaſt Rhetorical ſpeeches loſe the queſtion, and ſo the reſolve differ from the matter firſt propoſed. He ſeems therefore to diſallow ſuch figures of ſpeech, as too popular, and unbecoming a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-board, or looking upon eloquence and rhetorick, as too amuſing and deceitful, and not allowing it, but in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the mind of the auditors ſome prejudice they are prepoſſeſſed off; for, ſays he, ſometimes there is a neceſſity of a fomentation, or warm hand to chafe in the oyl; yet he likewiſe allows, ſo they will hold to the queſtion, that a matter may be debated, that is fit to be rejected, ſo it be in order to find out ſomewhat, that may be fit upon the firſt propoſition to be agreed unto; and he gives an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, philoſophical, or chymical and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical illuſtration thereof, ſaying, <hi>a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43868:86"/> is more pregnant of direction than an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; as aſhes are more generative than duſt.</hi> Thus council ſhould neither be given nor taken in haſte; deliberation being eſſential thereunto, if the affair will any ways per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; otherwiſe courage muſt ſupply council; for no fruit requires more time for ripeneſs, than doth council. Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation like the warmth of a chimney, that hath a tree behind it, makes the fruit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſoft, but not mellow and well taſted. And thus it fares with all other matters; for a forced ripeneſs prejudices both a good taſte and nouriſhment. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is no where better ſet forth than in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus,</hi> ch. 22. v. 16. and 17. <hi>It ſettles the heart upon a thought of underſtanding,</hi> (or weighs conſequences) <hi>for,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber girt and bound together in a building can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be looſed with ſhaking, ſo the heart, that is ſtabliſhed by adviſed council, ſhall fear at no time.</hi>

               <p>If a Prince ignorantly or paſſionately wave the true intereſt of his Nation, or too ſtrongly ſtem the tide of his Peoples inclination, ſuch Treaties never laſt long; and yet a wiſe Prince may rather give way unto the torrent of ſome proſperous Prince, and bow to his fortune, than put matters to the hazard of a doubtful war. Thus ſuch as are drawn from their proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by an unavoidable neceſſity, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for making ſuch abrupt changes, or giving ſuch aſſiſtances, as Boccalini ſays, the ſmaller Princes of Italy were by Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo; ſince men of their ſmall intereſt in the world, though it be an indecent thing, (ſays he) muſt chew their meat on both ſides their chops.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43868:89"/> comes. And in theſe diſguiſes the Popiſh Princes have more advantage than any Proteſtant, though they ſometimes find out a Soldier or a Merchant, that uſually frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Court, and ſo can perſonate a man of one profeſſion, and act, as of another. By ſuch clandeſtine means as theſe, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is often ended, before it's known to be begun; and then the real Ambaſſador is a man rather of pomp than of buſineſs. Nay, when Princes find the inconveniencies of former Treaties, as if it were by way of ſuper-fetation, they are kindling of a new Treaty before they are delivered of an old. Thus our Henry the eighth found the French and Spaniard proclaiming a league againſt him, when at the ſame time his Ambaſſador entred . . . . . to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the performance of a former Treaty then in being. And Philip Comines lay at Venice to make a league for Lewis the eleventh with that State, when, whilſt he lay there, and perceived it not, the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Spaniards made a league againſt his Maſter. And ſo were the Venetians themſelves ſerved at Cambray, where moſt of the States of Chriſtendom united againſt them, and they diſcovered it not, but it was like to have proved very fatal and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous to them; and yet it is obſerved, that this grave and wiſe Nation uſually
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43868:89"/> recover by Treaties of peace that which they often loſe by miſadventures of war; whilſt the ſame Comines gives the reverſe of this medal to us Engliſh men, when he ſays, <hi>We were never happy in our quill, when it was made into a pen; but when the feather was fixt to an arrow.</hi> The very manner of treating carries with it a great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Maſter of Ceremonies, who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually is, and ought to be a man of good literature, as well as languages, hath a large province, even in adjuſting the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that belong unto the Ambaſſadors, in relation to their Maſters, and in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to other Princes Ambaſſadors, reſient upon the place. He that inſpects our Sir John Finett's obſervations or memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and Sir Charles Cotterell's explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or additions thereunto, not publiſhed yet, and he that knew both the men, may juſtly ſay, they filled their places; and a late Hollander, Monſieur Wickefort, hath written a ſerious tract, and a neceſſary upon this ſubject, and of the priviledges of Ambaſſadors, as there are many more, who have written large and wiſe Tracts upon their offices.</p>
               <p>When Princes begin Treaties themſelves by interviews, they are ſeldom (and yet ſometimes) proſperous; for one appears a comlier perſon than the other, or is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43868:90"/> prompt in diſcourſe, more magnificent, leſs affable, or hath ſomewhat, which the other wants, which raiſes emulation or envy, or elſe their train diſagree, and breed ill will betwixt the Maſters: and yet Lewis the twelfth and Ferdinand of Arragon, and Charles the fifth and Pope Clement the ſeventh interviewed and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fairly.</p>
               <p>Great caution is to be uſed, how Princes entertain motions of Treaties, even by themſelves or by their Allies, whilſt they are in the heat of action; for thus Pope Julio the ſecond, under pretence of a Treaty with the Duke of Ferrara, chilled Lewis the twelfth, or diverted him from thoſe aſſiſtances, which he meant to give that Duke, upon ſuppoſal they would not have been needful. Therefore in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures, it is more needful for Princes to ſtrengthen, than leſſen their forces.</p>
               <p>Arbitration is ſometimes a uſeful, often a frivolous cement of peace; for after much time hath been ſpent therein, ſome pretty fetch will make the whole labour inſignificant; as when the Venetians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up their ſentence betwixt the Pope and Maximilian with a proviſo, that if both parties would not ratifie it, neither ſhould be obliged by it.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:43868:90"/>
               <p>A Prince Arbitrator ought to be unbyaſt, and equal in judgment towards both; but to become a party, whilſt he is an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator, darkens his honour and his juſtice very much. And a Northern Prince late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid dear for it, being driven out of all thoſe Countries, which his Predeceſſors had not long before by victories gained, and by Treaties had confirmed unto them, though the proſperity of the Prince, whoſe party they joyned themſelves unto, to his great honour (for there is nothing more honourable fot a Prince, than expencefully and hazardouſly to be concerned for an Ally) procured them a reſtitution of all, and yet removed not a dependance upon himſelf. How it will fare with that State, that in the apprehenſion they had of their own concerns, made and joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a declining Monarchy, (at leaſt declining in their vicinity) and in that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt loſt almoſt all they had, and then upon the like politick conſideration, drew in other great Princes to ſuccor them, which entirely drew from them the whole power they lay ſubjugated unto; ſo as their overflown inland, like their ſea-coaſts, had that tide of fortune drawn from their low grounds, which ſoon overflowed their higher countries; how theſe will fare in neceſſitating the others, to make a very
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43868:91"/> diſadvantageous peace, time will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, not my ſpirit of propheſie foretel.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Trade.</note>Trade or commerce is the off-ſpring of confederation, and flows from council, and is to be managed by juſtice, which is guided by religion. Thus religion is the foundation of all other pillars, and reaches to confederation and trade; for both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation and trade require great care and judgment in making the articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, and religion in obſerving them: for Princes or States confederate for ſecurity, and trade for gain; ſo as trade is a moſt natural root for raiſing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as treaſure is a moſt natural food for arms.

               <p>Forreign trade is but the ſame thing in a market more remote,<note place="margin">Forreign trade.</note> and under the laws of another Soveraign.</p>
               <p>Every County at home and Country abroad abounds in ſome one commodity or other, which others want, for venting whereof they have proper markets and ſeaſons, which muſt be obſerved, or the gain of the trade is uſually loſt.<note place="margin">The want in one place in the ground of trading with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and fruits of the earth are better in ſome places than in others; even by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the clime, or by reaſon of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; and may be aſſorded cheaper from one part than another, by reaſon of the multitude of labourers or artiſts, and the little wages is given in one part of a Country in proportion to another, or by reaſon of the conveniency of carriage. The King lives by the field, as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, therefore husbandry is to be as much cheriſhed, as any trade, for it breeds healthy and ſtrong men, and ſit for arms, and ſo in an iſland Mariners ought to be a

Every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment hath an intereſt in the labours, and in the manner of labouring of their people, and therefore they are to be drawn off from ill cuſtoms; or from deceitful working, as the Iriſh were from fixing their plough to the horſe tail, or the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers from ſo working their cloths, as they ſhrink too much, or over-tenter them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Voiture or making carriage eaſie by cutting rivers, providing high-ways to be well kept and paſtable, nay, providing they be ſecure againſt the thieves, ought to be a care of the State, in relation even unto trade; for the induſtrious man muſt be ſecured by the State in his habitation,<note place="margin">The things which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure trade.</note> and in his paſſages from place to place with his commodity, leaſt the waſps and drones prey on the hive, and drive the bee from her induſtry; therefore eaſie pardons to thieves and highway-men is a deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to trade. Monopolers are another ſort of thieves, for they impoſe what rates they pleaſe upon a neceſſary commodity, and rob the buyer as well as the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, whom they force to work at their own rates, when they have engroſſed a commodity into their own hands. A State muſt therefore ſecure the Subjects property, and endeavor to raiſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and to countenance his ingenuity
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43868:92"/> in any thing, that promotes trade, as framing engines, or any thing that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it. It muſt provide againſt the rich oppreſſing the poor Tradeſman, that too often muſt borrow, by not taking too great or biting uſury, or ſuch broakage as makes the poor laborious honeſt man or trader only work for the wealthy idle hard hearted perſon. It muſt give immunities, priviledges, and encouragements to all kind of induſtry. It muſt in ſome ſort force men to promote publick good; as to prohibit men not to turn their tillage too much into paſturage, for that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate.

Nothing better ſecures trade, than the true manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing of its commodities. It is part therefore of the care of a State, that no perſon or company employ ill or raw workmen: for a pound of wooll, which may coſt ſix or eight pence, if it be well wrought, may be worth two ſhillings or half a crown; but if ill wrought, not ſcarce one.

There are too too many more inſtances to be found; but I fell upon this, becauſe it wounds us in our chief ſtaple commodity. Our State ſhould be more careful of this than other States; for to our ſhame we muſt confeſs it, our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its genius (at leaſt in individual perſons) is too much given to lazineſs, and to affect a ſudden gain and return, and not to affect publick works, or ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire time to ripen; or ſuch as relate to poſterity, or ſuch as conduce to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Nation, and not preſent and perſonal profit.

So as though he ſails unto both Indies, yet thereby he hopes to fall upon Holland and England. Nor had he become conſiderable, but as the jealouſies of Holland towards us ſhrowded him, till he thruſt forth a top, that will ſhade us both, unleſs we hold a

               <p>But to revert to our proper ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, trade. No nation can be great or rich, that abounds not in ſome part of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in ſhipping, or who neglects trade, and who hath not in his own dominions, or imports not materials for manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Yet it is no policy to think to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs it, or be monarchs of it, as Holland hath for a time affected and purſued that <hi>ſea-monarchy,</hi> as eagerly as Charles the fifth, or Francis the firſt did the <hi>land mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:</hi> but it is wiſdom to divide the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit with neighbour Nations amicably. We throve not, when we could not content
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43868:96"/> our ſelves with the manufactory of our cloths, but muſt prohibit the tranſporting white and undy'd. Merchandizing, like the ſea ſhore, is made ſmooth and even both among our ſelves and Forreigners,<note place="margin">Companies, or trade managed by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> not by governing all parts of it by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, or wholly excluding Neighbours. Companies for home and nigh trades are not very advantagious. They are always of moſt uſe, when they exclude no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate traders; and yet they cannot ſubſiſt, if all Interlopers be under no reſtraint; therefore it may be well thought, that no man ſhould be permitted freely to trade, where Companies are erected, but under the regulation of that Company, nor that Company make ſuch chargeable by-laws, as ſhould diſcourage young and free tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; therefore Companies may by a Council of State or Parliaments be well countenanced, if regulated; ſo as they ſhould admit private Traders upon ſuch rules, as the Council of State, not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould ſet down as equal betwixt both. Two Companies we have, viz. that of the Eaſt-Indies, and the Turky, which trades would ſoon fall to irreparable diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they were not ſupported by ſuch pillars. The great covetous rapacious Stateſmen in either of theſe Countries and places, would ſoon daſh private Merchants
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43868:97"/> againſt one another, and one Nations bribes would eat their Neighbours out, if the wiſdom of ſuch ſocieties prevented it not.</p>
               <p>The Eaſt-India Company in Holland is a little monarchy, Amſterdam hath a half, Middlebrough and Zealand a fourth, Horn and Enchuyſen a ſixth, and the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main we may ſay ſerves to gratifie ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terloping perſons or places, as they will admit of. The ſoveraignty of this trade is in the States General, who renew the Charter upon a conſiderable fine to this Company, uſually once in—years.</p>
               <p>Had we not a trade in India, and a Company to govern that trade, the Pepper and Callicoes we bring home for nine pence would coſt us two ſhillings or half a crown, if brought us by the Hollanders. And this is proved too clearly unto us, by the Spice trade they have engroſſed, and caſt us out of, at the price of ſo much infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and blood. And our Eaſt-India and Turky Ships, beſides the Mariners, wherewith they muſt be manned, are a great ſecurity to the Nation.</p>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greatneſs, nor honour, nor ſecurity will be maintained without it.

Princes therefore were Lords paramount of the land they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, which made the Kings of Iſrael ſo great Herdſmen, and to have occaſion of ſo many men to reap their harveſt.

Princes therefore never more wounded their government, nor leſſened their reverence, than when they parted with their Patrimonial eſtates, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on ſubſidiary aids (even for their own ſubſiſtance) of their ſubjects;<note place="margin">Subſidiary.</note> for that leſſened their honour, and raiſed the pride, and conſequently begot contumacy in their people; for it is natural for men to think, whom they freely give unto, they oblige; not conſidering, that the ſame duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the Politick Body, as unto the Natural, where every member muſt ſend

               <p>Prerogatives of Princes were a kind of treaſure to them:<note place="margin">Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives a kind of treaſure.</note> for Tenures and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Wardſhips, Purveyances, and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in nature of a revenue, and ſet forth their honour, eaſed their charge, and preſerved the dependancies of ſubjects on them. If we would look back into our own Hiſtory, and conſider how either the neglect, or ſome forced neceſſity, or ſome falſe policy have wrung theſe from our Princes, we may diſcern in a great meaſure our own preſent diſtempers. The Conqueror brought in with him great and independent Lords,<note place="margin">Lords aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> rather as aſſiſtants than ſubjects; or as men to divide the prey with him; and therefore unto many of theſe, he gave large territories, with that, which the French call <hi>Baſſe Juſtice;</hi> ſo as their Tenants depended in a manner as much on them, as they did on the King, as Lord paramount. This bred the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons wars;<note place="margin">Barons wars.</note> for though the Barons would tyrannize over their vaſſals, yet they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, the ſoveraign Prince muſt be made as weak and limited, as poſſibly they could.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43868:99"/> even in the Royal family,<note place="margin">The diſpute of title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Royal families.</note> and the red Roſe and the white become enſigns of a long and bloody civil war. And as men took part with either of theſe, upon ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, they were to be rewarded, and by the various changes the crown, even by its proſperities, was rather weakned than ſtrengthened. Theſe Lay-quarrels begat a harveſt for the then ambitious and gripple Clergy: ſo as the Crown both by its Lords Spiritual and Temporal was in a great meaſure lorded over. This made that deep ſighted Prince,<note place="margin">

All theſe concuſſions caſt the crown, as we may ſay, chiefly into the hands of the Commons, the third State of this Realm; and the Lords, who were blinded with the hope of an Ariſtocracy, or at leaſt ſome addition of power, which they ſeemed now to want, ſo joyned with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as that the uſual failures of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Charles the firſt's time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the overthrow both of King and Lords.<note place="margin">

And ſuch is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of Nobility, that when ſervilely they have ſerved <hi>to pull down the crown,</hi> they have for their reward a vote of being an <hi>uſeleſs State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee a State loſes its health and ſtrength by affecting ſome unwholſom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; but it is an irrational thing in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to expect ſafety and protection, and yet to have an unwillingneſs in a Deſpoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government, as France is almoſt now, arbitrarily to be taxed, (for that unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs or ſullen murmuring doth but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43868:100"/> a ſharper tyranny) or in a limited and mixt Monarchy, as England is, to be ever ſelling their aids; for that is but crumbling the power of Soveraignty, and often ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it more ſevere to the Subject in the hand of ſome inferiors. For as no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can want an arbitrary power, ſo this is moſt ſeverely executed, where it is done by a numerous and inferior body. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the long Parliament of 1640. when taxes were ſo multiplied, and various charges laid on the Subject (which Tacitus obſerves and calls, <hi>varia praedandi vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la)</hi> that we had <hi>monthly taxes, contributions, loanes, fifth and twentieth parts, new ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for weekly taxes for the Britiſh army in Ireland, for reducing Oxford,</hi> (the Sanctuary and place of the Kings reſidence) <hi>diſtinct taxes for an Eaſtern and Weſtern Aſſociation, and for particular places, as Newark,</hi> &amp;c. and for <hi>buying in</hi> and (as we may call it) <hi>ſelling, or ſending out the Scotch army.</hi> I dare not look forward, but I pray unto Providence to divert real provocations, if imaginary or light could bring on us ſo much miſery, and that thoſe whom it concerns, may conſider how much treaſure they have ſpent of the Nations (beſides other ſad conſequences) by their impatience, and not freely giving a little, when a little would have ſerved, as all King Charles
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43868:101"/> the firſt's time it would have done. What it coſt afterwards, through the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Reign or Protectorſhip, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned taxes are proof enough.</p>
               <p>I that vent rather ſtrong deſires and wiſhes than write Politicks, would be glad that the Crowns deſmeaſnes were both plentiful and unalienable, further than for a leaſe of 40 or 50 years, to reward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Miniſters of State, and good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for thô there muſt be an overflow for ſome Favorites, (for Princes are but men) yet thoſe fall not under my thoughts to provide for, but that the magnificence and ſplendor of a Court, and the hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Houſhold, and the ordinary and neceſſary expences of Guards, Garriſons, and ſtanding and uſual Navies for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Channel, or conduct of the Merchant, ſhould not be precarious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably would conduce more unto the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace of the Nation, and proſperity of the Subject, than unto the Princes; but this is not fit for me to deſcant upon. I would never rob the people by the plenty of a Princes conſtant revenue, of having the means of ſhewing their good affection and loyalty by their bounty to their Prince; for it is an evidence they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a free Government, that they are not neceſſitated to give, as it is an evidence
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43868:101"/> that they are under an unſafe Government, that the Prince muſt be often forced, for the neceſſary expences of the Government, to depend on the good-will or humour of his People; for theſe have their viciſſitudes. <hi>Res angusta domi</hi> will make a Prince often ſo jealous of his affairs at home, that he will not dare to ſeek occaſion to promote them abroad. I ſhall harp too often upon that ſtring; but I believe neither French nor Dutch had been able to have changed the ballance of Chriſtendom (as notoriouſly it is ſince) if ſuch a good intelligence as I wiſh, had been kept betwixt the Prince and his three Eſtates. What 100000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> would have done in thoſe days in reſpect of military expences, 500000 <hi>l.</hi> will not do now; and I believe our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors feel it as well as our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Home taxes or ſubſidies, freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily given in Parliament, are the fitteſt ſupports for all extraordinary expences; but then theſe ſhould be endeavoured to be laid equally; for <hi>Livie</hi> calls a Dooms-day book (or equal tax) <hi>res ſaluberrima, magno futura imperio,</hi> and it is much better for a Prince, that his Nobles and Commons ſhould give, or lay the tax, by virtue of their liberty, than he receive or take it by virtue of his own Prerogative. For, ſays Chancellor Bacon, there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43868:102"/> betwixt a tax raiſed or given by the Repreſentatives of the People, and one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the abſoluteneſs of the Prince; for thô it be all one in the purſe, yet it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the payment; or it works diverſly on the courage and affections of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. One needs Themiſtocles's two God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes to raiſe it, power and perſwaſion, the other diſputes it, or would caſt it off, by two as forcible Goddeſſes, neceſſity and poverty.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Arms.</note>Arms is as conſiderable and neceſſary a pillar of Government, as any of the former, and I have caſt it in the laſt place, becauſe if men would be juſt, it would be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for the primary laws of juſtice are built or implanted in ſincere nature, and are ſufficient for the diſcharge of all publick and reciprocal duties, if they were obſerved. But arms or force are but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary inſtruments of juſtice, and are grounded upon depraved nature; for they are never to be uſed, but when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment cannot reduce the Governed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the obedience of juſtice, but by them. We uſually therefore ſay, they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to determine the controverſies of beaſts, not men; ſo as among men there ought to be no recourſe unto one, until the other is diſobeyed; for force is rightly termed <hi>ultima ratio Regum,</hi> or the laſt thing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43868:102"/> a Prince ſhould make uſe of. This is the iraſcible faculty in the ſoul of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or that which reſiſts the ataxia or diſorder in the politick Body, or in ſome member of it; or which gains that by fear, which ought to have been performed by love.</p>
               <p>This is that,<note place="margin">At home.</note> which fortifies juſtice at home, by ſeeing executed the penalties of the Laws, the proceſs of the ſeveral Courts, and their ſentences and judgments upon the caſes before them, whether thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences be capital, pecuniary, or corporal. This is that, which is to reduce the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to the common juſtice and laws of the land, to quell inſurrections, and to ſuppreſs rebellions. And when diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence comes to any of theſe heights, every Court of juſtice hath its proper officers to ſee its ſentences and decrees executed; ſo in caſes of riot, or contumacy backt by numbers, an obligation lies upon a whole County, by the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus</hi> or power of that County, which the Sheriff hath the conduct of, to ſubdue ſuch perſons. And in caſes of rebellion or inſurrections at home, or invaſion of Forreigners from abroad, every ſubject is bound to repreſs the ſame at the hazard of his life.<note place="margin">Rebellion, tho' it bring on a civil war, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a war.</note>

               <p>Arms are the proper inſtruments of war, but inſurrection or rebellion of Subjects is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43868:103"/> not properly to be called a war, tho' it be a uſe of force; for war muſt be made amongſt equals, which no perſons, nor order of ſubjects can be to their Soveraign, as hath been proved already. So as all well conſtituted Governments reject co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination as the diſtracter of all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the juſtification of a civil war; therefore the reſiſtance of Subjects is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, not war. Yet becauſe ſometimes the Rebels power is equal with the Princes, ſuch conteſts have got the name of a civil war.</p>

               <p>Remedies on the Subjects part are, to remember they are born under ſubjection, and are required of God to be ſubject, and to pay paſſive obedience, where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not active; therefore to be careful not to multiply grievances by inferences, or to think all will befall them that may, and to conſider, that it is very often impatience
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43868:103"/> under ſmall grievances, that throws them into the ſufferance of greater. Let the multitude or vulgars conſider, without their many hands no great changes or turmoils could be made; and let other well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men reflect, how often they are made properties of by cunning Deſigners and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of a well ſettled Government, whoſe abilities ſerve only to create a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding between King and People, and to manage the diſcontent of the ſubject to their own advantage, and to ſet forth all the failures of a Prince only to cloud the ill conſequences of their own innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, knowing,<note place="margin">The hope of Innovators.</note> if they can diſturb the ſettled Government, a People cannot be long without one, and then they, that have been acceptable for the ſervice in pulling down a building, are like to be employed in that, which is to be ſet up. This might keep the ſilly fiſh from too greedily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the bait, which will draw him out of his own proper element. The beſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian deſcribes theſe diſturbers very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, when he ſays, <hi>Honores, quos quietâ Republica deſperant, perturbatâ conſequi arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trantur.</hi> And thus the name of <hi>Liberty</hi> hath very often through the affecting changes brought the ſubject in general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſervitude. The ſobereſt and wiſeſt men therefore muſt not be beguiled herein by
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43868:104"/> indifferency, as are the multitude through giddineſs, and the well-meaning through not diſcerning conſequences to hearken to changes. All theſe being often taken in the common ſnare of Innovators; for there being ſeldom ſuch a happy conjuncture of a State, but that ſomewhat is to be juſtly condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, tho' at the ſame time the condition of the Subject is in the general very much to be thank't God for. Neuters defer their appearance in behalf of the Government ſo long, that when they would recover it they cannot, for the malignity of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ſoon infects the maſs of blood, and then theſe men either engage unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and ſo loſe themſelves and fortunes, or are lookt upon by the Innovator as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected perſons, and ſo undergo an equal load with thoſe, who worthily and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the beginning withſtand the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Cicero's letters to Pomponius Atticus, and Atticus's life, and Chancellor de Vaire (who lived in Paris in the time of the French league in Henry the thirds time, and Sir Walter Rawleigh upon ſuch a conjuncture, when the Romans and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians both ſtrove for Sicily) are parts of Story fit to be conſulted, to know how a man ſhould demean himſelf in ſuch times; which will reſolve it ſelf into this, that men ſhould timely aſſiſt the ſettled
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43868:104"/> Government, as obliged thereunto, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope in a change of what is amiſs from the erring legal Governors, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect remedies in the ſtate of the Publick by ſuch, who fly to arms to work refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The leaſt any man can do in ſuch a conjuncture, is with Pomponius Atticus, who took arms with neither ſide, yet owned Pompey, tho' not diſobliging Caeſar, or rather with Cato, tho' he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Pompeys greatneſs, yet engaged with him, who engaged for the preſent ſtate of Government. But whoever takes offices or charge with the Innovators, and thereby promotes their affairs, as Sir Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rawleigh concludes, may be reckoned partakers of their crime. It borders too nigh guilt, to let even the conſideration of a mans own perſon (I mean an eminent mans) or family, to ſway him ſo much, as to lead him dully to be paſſive in ſuch a conjuncture; but it ſtains both, when the world knows his judgment is one thing, and his practice another; for there is a time, when a man may ſay, Providence calls to Civil martyrdom, which is often in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the ſettled ſtate, never by Civil war in changing it.</p>
               <p>Remedies on the Princes part are,<note place="margin">Remedies on the Prince's part.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be watchful, that his courſe of life and councels be not ſuch, as may make
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43868:105"/> him unvaluable in the eyes of his ſubjects; that he be not found neceſſitous in his treaſure: for if in time of civil ſedition, he ſtand in need of money, in ſome ſort he ſtands at the courteſie of the ſubject, whoſe purſe and body both he ſhould not want at one time; for it was Nero's folly, that he ſtood moſt in need of the Subjects ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, when he had moſt need to have eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them therein; for he that hath had no foreſight of contingencies, is the unreadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier aided. A Prince therefore ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want a fit force, to keep himſelf from a ſurprizal, and a fit ſubſiſtance for ſome time for ſuch a body. And if he be but thus furniſhed, loyalty will keep them of his party, whom otherwiſe deſpair will drive from him; and falſe Brethren or Intelligencers will come over; eſpecially if the Prince's Miniſters be men of a good reputation, ſo as ſecurely intelligence may be held with them. And by ſuch means as theſe, diſcords may be raiſed among the rebellious, and they may be put upon ſuch raſh, or ſuch cautious councils, as may ruine them.</p>
               <p>Arms in the Politicks, is like fortitude in the Morals; it is the guard and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the other virtues. Civil juſtice grounded on, and managed by religion, is the ſoul of Government; but the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43868:105"/> prerogatives of it are treaſure and arms; for theſe are properly the ſinews, that make the members of Government move. As Government is the ordinance of God, theſe three are inſeparable from ſoveraignty: therefore none can make laws, but with the Prince, nor raiſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but for the Prince; for common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhews, men are bound unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Government with life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; but experience ſhews, when a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt degenerate man, (or men) whom Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath given ſoveraignty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, have both the ſoul and body (as we may call it) of Government in his (or their) hands, or arbitrarily at his (or their) diſpoſe, unwholſome laws may be made, i. e. ſuch as are partial, or ricket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſwelling the head too big, or a hectick or preternatural heat of the Soveraignty (be it Monarchy or State) may draw ſtrength too faſt from the habit of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; therefore divers mixt Governments reſerve a general conſent to accompany ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign authority, both in making laws and raiſing moneys: (though in neither of theſe nothing can be done by any but the ſoveraign perſons thus aſſiſted.) But arms or the Militia of the Nation (to ſhew the danger of co-ordination) is every where ſingly in the Prince or State; ſince if any but the Soveraign hath the power of raiſing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43868:106"/> the arms, they will be ſoon ſuppoſed to have the power of uſing them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man, how loyal ſoever, even for the ſafety of the Prince's perſon, can raiſe arms without his commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe remarks may appear trivial and pedantick, yet for want of ſuch a foreſight, or ſome grains of ſuch a powder, I have ſeen the affairs of a great King in convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſits.</p>
               <p>Thus much for arms, as they concern the civil adminiſtration of juſtice, and the repreſſion of rebellion at home, or as theſe being oppoſed by ſubjects, ariſe unto a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil war.<note place="margin">Forreign war.</note> Now we will conſider arms, as by them one equal (or who hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the other) endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the other unto juſtice, i. e. to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe laws of Nations which are binding either by the law of Nature or Nations, or which are obligatory by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome league or treaty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, made between two Nations.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43868:106"/> and to be his own juſticiar: (but this is but accidental, and may be properly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a natural authority to repel force by force; or is a private war.)

Nay,<note place="margin">Yet the ground of it muſt be juſt.</note> they ought not to begin a war, until ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely they have endeavoured to obtain a ſatisfaction by way of peace. Humanity then obliges to avoid it, and neceſſity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warrants the undertaking it. Says Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes therefore, <hi>When thou goeſt to war, enquire of the Lord,</hi> or go unto his Oracles or
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43868:107"/> Word, or thine own conſcience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, whether the occaſion of the war be juſt and lawful. Conſult not the pravity of human nature, which would lay land to land, or upon an unreaſonable fear, that others will invade thee, (which hath been the common, but improſperous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of mankind, (as Mr. Hobbs phraſes it.) Anticipate not, or invade not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's power, who hath not wronged thee, for fear by that power, he may wrong thee, which, as Thucidides ſets forth, was ſuch a juſtifying argument amongſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, who warranted themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, becauſe it was the practice of moſt men, as if it had been the wiſdom and rectitude of the nature of mankind, though they found both the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and all their ſmaller Allies confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating againſt them, becauſe they made this their boundleſs ambition to be a child of juſtice. Since that could not be the off-ſpring of juſtice, which by more men than thoſe that uſed it, was complained of, as an axiom of injuſtice. Neither uſe thoſe modern Policies, which propoſe a forreign war, as a Scavingry of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of the people. Nor let thy plenty ariſe out of others miſery, by keeping two neighbors in the calamity of war, that thou may'ſt enjoy the plenty of peace. But

True it is, the luxury of one Prince and the covetouſneſs of another State, may be ſcourged by the rapacity and vain-glory of a third; but God permits what he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, and Princes are innocent in the acts they do, not from the ſuitableneſs of their deeds with his pleaſure, but from the conformity of them to his law. Neither was one Prince to ſurprize another, but firſt to ſend his Herauld, and denounce hoſtility, and to uſe thoſe other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which the uprightneſs of elder times obſerved, or condemned, when not obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For ſince the lives and eſtates of ſo many innocent perſons are involved in a war, humanity requires, that if poſſibly it can, it be declined. Since the villainous nature hereof could not avoid the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frauds, ambuſhes, falſe intelligences, and many more ſtratagems; nay, knew not, how to avoid cruelties and inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conflagrations, which in all other caſes would be abhorred; for the Soldier, like the Huntſman, was allowed his gin as well as his bow, and might corrupt his enemies men, as well as employ his own. All which is to be underſtood, <hi>flagrante
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43868:108"/> bello;</hi> for in times of truce and ceſſation of arms, there ought to be a great reſtraint upon the former liberty. Methinks, that God made it a great reſtraint upon the beſt and wiſeſt Princes, and even upon the moſt injured, not raſhly to run into a war; ſince conqueſt gave, or was the mother of a right even unto dominion; ſo hazardous it was even to vindicate an injury by this inhuman courſe; for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs did not always attend upon the beſt cauſe. And it is a great evidence a Prince had juſt thoughts, when he began his war, if he appeared apt to end it upon moderate and reaſonable conditions, or <hi>ne victis quidem praeter injuriae licentiam cripere.</hi> Neither doth he grant peace, that grants it not, till he hath ruined his enemy; for that is not, as the Hiſtorian ſays, <hi>pacem dare,</hi> but <hi>ſolitudinem facere.</hi> Among Chriſtians ſure I am, it ought to be begun upon great deliberation, and to be managed with tenderneſs and reluctance even upon the conſiderations of humanity. And ſince the event is ſo uncertain, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes's councel ſurely is very reaſonable, <hi>When thou art to make a war, be ſure to keep thy ſelf from every wicked thing; for the Lord walketh in the midſt of the camp;</hi> and keep it clean free from dung, that there may be ſalubrity of body and purity of mind.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:43868:108"/>
               <p>Princes are to reaſon with themſelves, whether with 10000 they can meet with their enemy that hath 20000; or whether they be ſupplied by Confederates or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries; for both theſe are inſecure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on. For Confederates have moſt commonly ſeparate and ſingle intereſts of their own, and Mercenaries are without any affection or good will to the cauſe, having their eye only upon the pay, and that is very often dazled, when the enemy can give them a better. Beſides, as they have mercenary bodies, they too often have mercenary minds; for this ſort of men in any extremity (which is uſual to befal men in a ſtate of war) have not that virtue and generoſity to undergo the toil and hazard of their preſent condition; Beſides, this may give Princes caution, how they engage in a war, ſince their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proſperity creates them new enemies, and ſome neuter Prince riſes up in behalf of the conquered, and reduces all to ſome nighneſs of equality or ſtate, which the war at firſt was begun upon. If choice or neceſſity lead them to undertake a war, they can have no wiſer councel, than that which the Delphic Oracle gave unto the Lacedemonians, <hi>viz,</hi> carry it on with all their power, or rather to overdo than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo it; for then there is no retreat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43868:109"/> great loſs or great diſhonor; ſo as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting preparations of all neceſſaries are not to be ſought for, when they are to be uſed; for that war is ſure to continue longeſt, that is leaſt provided for, when it is firſt begun. Nor muſt the Prince for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly run into it, upon a probability of his enemies overſight, but upon a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his own foreſight. Nor ſhould the confidence or forwardneſs of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, (eſpecially if they have percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in himſelf a ſtrong inclination to the engagement) lead him to think, he ſhall meet with a conſtancy of fervor; for diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers (which are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companions of a war) in action change thoſe tempers of mind, which firſt appeared in councel. Safeſt therefore it is, and moſt commonly thoſe Princes thrive beſt in war, who foreſee, and are ableſt to digeſt improſperities. The Germans never thought the Romans invincible, till they found no ill ſucceſs or misfortune could daunt them. This ſpirit in the Athenians, after their great loſſes in Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, made the Lacedemonians and their Confederates, as much apprehend their ſtomachfulneſs, as they had before at any time apprehended their power.</p>

Rome was in an ill caſe, when this ſecret was diſcloſed, that a Prince could be made elſewhere than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her walls, or that too common Soldiers even within her walls could transfer her empire, and give her an Otho for a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.

                  <note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>Having thus laid the foundation, that all civil power, and the Soveraign Perſons that execute it, are of divine ordinance, and that the prerogatives belonging to both, are in intuition of the peace and ſafety of the whole ſociety, and in honour and ſecurity
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43868:111"/> of the head of that Politick Body; and therefore that they are not to be reſiſted, but both power and perſon to be held ſacred, or ſo ſet apart, that the power in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript or laws be indiſputable, and the perſon in the execution thereof unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; we may ſay, here is firm ground to raiſe our pillars or vital principles of Government upon; and on theſe we may rear the roof of wiſdom's houſe, and aſſert, that honeſty is the beſt policy; ſince by the light of nature or common reaſon, it is agreed as <hi>Epictetus</hi> ſays, that <hi>the Gods juſtly and wiſely adminiſter all things, and that they have ty'd children and ſubjects unto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Princes, not as they are good, but as they are Parents and Princes;</hi> and therefore for ſuch bleſſings men are more to depend on their providence, than their own choice or wiſdom. For remove Government and Governours from this divine ordinance, and the principles of Policy ſhall, like the atoms of Lucretius, make mankind of ſuch an unquiet nature, that he ſhall be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſenſitive appetites and preſent advantages, rather than by thoſe innate principles, which by the moral virtues of his mind, have fitted him to exerciſe his own goodneſs, and to bear with other mens (eſpecially Governors) failures, or vices, and rather to pray for a good Prince, than
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43868:112"/> reſiſt a bad. And the ſame virtues will teach Princes, that there are no ſuch poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as thoſe that are ethical; others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but like the pleaſures of titillation, earneſtly ſought for or delightfully uſed, but ſoon repented of. Marcus Aurelius's fame will be deſireable by a thinking man, when Alexanders and Julius Caeſars will be eſteem'd worthleſs, and when Neroes and Caligula's will be found ignominious. And when the ambitions of Charles V. and Philip II. and Francis I. and the great Henry's and Lewis's are conſidered, it may be feared, that Aſia and Gentiliſme owe more thereunto, than doth Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Chriſtianity. Macchiavilian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of policy there can be none ſteady, and yet there may be many proſperous, becauſe they look after the end and deſpiſe the means, and moſt unnaturally they do often make proſperous a vice, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſome ſeeming virtue, and thus by ſome immoral means, drive at ſome poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick end; for <hi>quocun<expan>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> modo rem</hi> is their axiom. Such ſort of men as theſe think it no diſhonour, if they can ſweep the ſtake, tho' they be found playing with falſe dice. Nor have they any remorſe, that by treachery they have deceived their friend or benefactor. Nothing of all this is ſaid to make the Phyſicians of State ſo
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43868:112"/> cautious, as not to know how in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a cordial to make uſe of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents fleſh; for a nice piety or a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous policy (I think at leaſt) is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, even by God himſelf, from men of this condition, without there were an aſſurance of a clear openneſs and integrity on the other part. Therefore Macchiavel and Tacitus, and men of that form, are excellent Authors to give caution, when they are dangerous Guides to follow. The honeſt man therefore is not the fool, for he can let live in his houſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but not in his breaſt; and he can ſhake off animal policy, to entertain Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. He hath theſe mixt in his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum; for as in himſelf he is both ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and rational, ſo in his politick conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution he is made up of the ſerpent, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part, and the rational and dove-like. Theſe are not to be kept apart in him, but he is to be compounded of; but the dove muſt be the ſoul of his policy.</p>
               <p>If we would ſeek another topick to prove all this, we would have recourſe to the whole Hiſtories of the world; and through all of them we ſhall find, that thoſe carnal policies, which are to corrupt mens councels, are very uſeful to be known, ſince it is as neceſſary for a Traveller to be well hatted, booted, and coated againſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43868:113"/> foul weather and ways, as to be well hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to carry him his direct road. But obſerve all Hiſtories, and they do as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies do, (or at leaſt ſhould do) diſcover many treacheries and vices, but in their concluſion they make them improſperous, and give the reward to virtue. And this further light we may borrow from them, that both Greek and Roman, (and if the ſubtil wit of the one, and the courage of the other could not, or did not prevent it, no ſucceeding nations or times ever did or will attain it) who moſt oppoſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Power, never attained their Idol liberty, by manacling of Monarchy. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſterous it was to Athens, and it coſt more blood, and interrupted more the proſperity of Rome than any thing elſe; for both Livie and Tacitus ſet forth, how when Kings abuſed their ſoveraignty, that people ſought to find their liberty in two Conſuls, to whom ſoveraign authority was neceſſary to be intruſted; and theſe (as no men living ever did, or could make their affairs ever proſperous) became ſoon not only to be complain'd of in improſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times, but to be envied, when they had the moſt ſucceſs; for inferiors (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they think they create their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors) never want their paſſion. So as the Conſuls fell ſoon into their diſpleaſure
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43868:113"/> and jealouſie, and a ſhort liv'd <hi>Decemviri</hi> muſt rectifie (as they did diſorder) this ſtate of government, and the people, in whom the ſoveraign power was ſaid to be lodged, muſt be protected by Tribunes, choſen from the Commons, and then by Tribunes Military, that might give check untô the Conſulary authority. But all this was but a rolling of a ſick man in his bed, and the beſt medicin they ever took was a Dictator, who ſilenced all other powers, and ſingly exerciſed all power; ſo as here was Monarchy in its heighth or achme; for the Dictator was a Prince bound by no law, nor clogged with any partnerſhip, only it was temporary and ſhort-liv'd; which is proof enough, (thô extremity and neceſſity teach the doctrine) that all truſt is ſafelieſt lodged in one, and that failures in government will attend the beſt conſtitution of government, and that variety of changes are but ſo many infirmities of a ſtate, and at laſt ſo diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all wiſe and good men, from depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a populacy, that a Cinna or a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, a Pompey, a Craſſus, or a Caeſar, will in a diſguiſe, (or by a barefac'd challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) at laſt ſo weary and weaken by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil diſcords the people, that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſe the change of their condition with ſecurity, than endeavor to recover
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43868:114"/> their old pretended liberty with danger. It is the want of good eyes, or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Optick nerve, that makes men not perceive the uſefulneſs of ſoveraign prerogatives, even in relation to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and well governing of ſubjects. For the terror of power often keeps the State qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and ſecure, when the belief of liberty breeds that irreverence unto the wiſdom of Governors, that they kindle thoſe ſparks of contumacy, which ſet all into a flame. Few men have learnt this leſſon, but thoſe, who have lived in times of civil diſtraction; and therefore the concluſion ſhall be, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is an ordinance of God; whoſe wiſdom having deſigned men to live in ſociety, made politick, like natural, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, conſiſt of a head and divers members, lodging life in the body, and ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the head; ſo as human laws, (grounded on ſound reaſon and adapted to the genius of the people, and unto the various publick and private concerns, and derived (as nigh as might be) from the moral virtues, or the equity of them by nature implanted in mankind) were like the ſalt in the natural body, which tied all parts together, by prudence promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting publick before private good or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and by juſtice preſerving the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of tenderneſs and beneficence commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43868:114"/> from the head, and of cheerful and ready obedience yielded from the body; and by patience, a moſt neceſſary and eminent virtue in this corrupted and laps'd ſtate of man, (like mortification, on which even religion her ſelf is now founded) each bearing the others infirmities; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a temper the publick peace or health of ſtate is loſt. Unto which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, O Lord, reſtore this poor giddy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
